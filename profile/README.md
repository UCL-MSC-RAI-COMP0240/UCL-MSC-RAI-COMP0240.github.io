# COMP0240 Aerial Robotics Practical

Welcome to the tutorials and practicals for the UCL Computer Science MSC Robotics and AI module **COMP0240 Aerial Robotics** 2025 Edition. 

This tutorial website follows along with the 10 week, 2nd term course intended for practical tutorials of around 2-3hrs a week. 

## About

The purpose of these practicals is to give you hands on experience in working with drones, drone system and drone autonomy in simulation and reality to the extent possible in the classroom.  

The practicals are split into 
- 3 Practicals
- 2 Challenges

Each of the practicals has a document on the left hand side of this page. The intention is that you follow the instructions to get the basics working, and then you explore the topic through doing the tasks. 

The practicals should one by one hopefully build up the skills, knowledge and intuition required to complete the challenges.

The challenges serve as this courses assessed component. Due to the complexities of dealing with hardware, and to enable student exploration of the different challenges within robotics, these will be group challenges. The challenges revolve around the technical exploration in solving a particular problem and communicating your solution through a presentation. 

**The key repositories have been pinned to the organisation page**
