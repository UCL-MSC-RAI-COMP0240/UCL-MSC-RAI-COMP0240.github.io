# Practical 1: Flying Crazyflies

In this first practical we are jumping in and getting hands on with flying crazyflies around with simple shapes autonomously. 

## Crazyflies

### What are Crazyflies

### Why are we using them

## Crazyflie Setup and Installation

For this, let us follow Bitcraze's own introductory tutorials:

## Tasks

1. Follow ths instructions and setup the physical crazyflie
2. Setup the software and connect your crazyflie
    - Can you see the live sensor feed? 
3. Can you perform manual flight with the keyboard
    - How does the crazyflie respond to your keypresses - is it sluggish? fast to react? 
    - Do you think this is a good way to control a drone? 
4. Using the crazyflie python library, write a simple script which (1) takesoff the drone, (2) flies to another point (3) lands
    - What are the commands needed to achieve takeoff? 
    - How accurate is the drones takeoff height? 
    - How well does it fly to the other point, can you characterise it? 
    - How good is the landing? 
    - How repeatable is the flight? 
5. Now make the drone do something interesting
    - e.g. Fly a more interesting pattern? Perform an experiment to find the accuracy of the system?
