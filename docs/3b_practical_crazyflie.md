# Practical 3: Crazyflie Build and Installation

[TOC]

## Build


The first step is to unbox your crazyflie kit and build your crazyflie! 

To take you through the unboxing and first time setup, let us follow Bitcraze's own introductory tutorial which will hopefully get you to the state of flying!

Come back when you have finished bench testing and are ready to fly

> Notes: Be gentle with the parts - the crazyflie is hardy but the connectors might not be! We have small tools you can borrow if needed.
