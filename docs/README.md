# COMP0240 Aerial Robotics Practical

Welcome to the tutorials and practicals for the UCL Computer Science MSC Robotics and AI module **COMP0240 Aerial Robotics** 2025 Edition. 

This tutorial website follows along with the 10 week, 2nd term course intended for practical tutorials of around 2-3hrs a week. 

## About

The purpose of these practicals is to give you hands on experience in working with drones, drone system and drone autonomy in simulation and reality to the extent possible in the classroom.  

The practicals are split into 
- 3 Practicals
- 2 Challenges

Each of the practicals has a document on the left hand side of this page. The intention is that you follow the instructions to get the basics working, and then you explore the topic through doing the tasks. 

The practicals should one by one hopefully build up the skills, knowledge and intuition required to complete the challenges.

The challenges serve as this courses assessed component. Due to the complexities of dealing with hardware, and to enable student exploration of the different challenges within robotics, these will be group challenges. The challenges revolve around the technical exploration in solving a particular problem and communicating your solution through a presentation. 

## What We Will Cover

During these practicals, we aim for students to learn and pick up on the following skills:

- Familiarising yourself with basic drone hardware and components 
- Experience with using experimental micro-drone systems 
- Programming single and multiple micro-drone systems 
- Simulation to reality development pipelines
- Experience with industrial drone systems
- Solving real-world problems with drone systems 

### Practical 1 

> Weeks 1 and 2

In practical 1, in pairs, you will be putting together and attempting to fly an educational micro-drone platfrom known as the crazyflie. 
- You will need to assemble the micro-drone
- Work out how to fly the drone
- Autonomously fly the drone using the crazyflie API

### Practical 2

> Weeks 2 and 3

In practical 2, we start adding system complexity by re-introducing ROS2 and the aerostack2 drone system management platform or interfacing with drone systems. 
- Installing ROS2 and Learning about aerostack2 and what capabilities it gives us
- Applying ROS2 to drone applications 
- Learning simulation to real development pipeline 

### CW1: Structural Inspection Path Planning Challenge

> Weeks 4, 5 and 6

For the first challenge, you will be working individually primarily in simulation to solve a key part of the structural inspection path planning problem. Your task will be in investigating and implementing solutions to finding the most optimal way of visiting a series of locations representing inspection locations, while avoiding the obstacles in the environment. 

This mirrors real life autonomous inspection scenarios which are the majority of current day use cases with autonomous drones. 

The challenge will be assessments criteria and method will be released closer to the time 

### Practical 3

> Week 7

In practical 3, we now introduce some more widely used systems within the drone ecosystem, namely the Pixhawk flight controller, PX4 flight control firmware stack and associated tools. The aim is to give some experience within systems which are more widely used in industry and research all over the world. 

In the session there will be a mix of software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation of drones using PX4 on Ubuntu, as well as hands on dissection of a small PX4 based quadcopter to understand the hardware setup. Hopefully by the end of the session we will be able to hook up the STIL with ROS2 and Aerostack2

### CW2: Grand Challenge - Exploring Real-Life Drone Use Cases

> Weeks 8, 9 and 10

In the last few weeks, you will be working in teams to complete the grand challenge in which will choose a particular scenario and solve the problem using one or more drones with the tools we have shown you. Your team will emulate a start-up type setup as a primary deliverable will be a 4 minute pitch to deliver to a panel of investors demonstrating your solution. 

The scenarios available, team sizes and assessment criteria will be released closer to the time.
