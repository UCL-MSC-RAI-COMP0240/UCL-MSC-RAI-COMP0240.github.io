# COMP0240 Aerial Robotics Practical

Welcome to the tutorials and practicals for the UCL Computer Science MSC Robotics and AI module **COMP0240 Aerial Robotics** 2025-2026 Edition. 

This website accompanies the 10-week, Term 2 practical component of the course. You will typically spend 2–3 hours per week engaging with guided tutorials, simulation exercises, and (where feasible) hands-on drone experiments.

## About

The aim of these practicals is to provide hands-on experience with aerial robotic systems, covering both simulation-based development and real-world micro-drone experimentation within a classroom and laboratory setting.

You will work with modern drone software stacks and hardware platforms to understand how autonomy is developed, tested, and deployed in practice.

The practical component is structured as:

- 3 Themed practicals (formative)
- 2 Challenges (assessed)

Each practical has a dedicated guide accessible from the navigation panel on the left. Working in groups of 2, you are expected to follow the instructions to establish baseline functionality, and then extend the system through exploratory tasks.

The practicals are designed to progressively build your technical skills, system understanding, and intuition, preparing you to complete the assessed challenges.

## Challenge Assessments

The challenges serve as this courses assessed component. Due to the complexities of dealing with hardware, and to enable student exploration of the different challenges within robotics, these will be group challenges. The challenges revolve around the technical exploration in solving a particular problem and communicating your solution through a presentation.  

## What You Will Learn

By completing the practicals and challenges, you will develop skills in:

- Familiarising yourself with basic drone hardware and components 
- Experience with using experimental micro-drone systems 
- Programming single and multiple micro-drone systems 
- Developing autonomy in simulation and transferring it to real systems
- Using industry-relevant drone software stacks
- Framing and solving real-world aerial robotics problems


### Practicals 1 & 2 - Foundations: ROS 2 and Aerostack2
> Duration: Weeks 1 and 2

Practical 1 introduces the core software tools used throughout the course. You will gain foundational experience with Linux, ROS 2, and Aerostack2, applied through a simulated drone project.

Topics include:
- Installing and configuring ROS 2
- Understanding Aerostack2 and its system-level capabilities
- Applying ROS 2 concepts to aerial robotics
- Developing a simulation-to-reality workflow

### Practicals 3 & 4  - Introduction to the crazyflie platform and setup
> Duration: Weeks 3 and 4

In pairs, you will assemble and fly an educational micro-drone platform known as the Crazyflie.

You will:
- Assemble the micro-drone hardware
- Learn safe and stable manual flight
- Implement autonomous behaviours using the Crazyflie API

This practical bridges simulation and real-world deployment at a small, safe scale.

### Practical 5 - CW1: Challenge 1 - Structural Inspection Path Planning Challenge (individual coursework)
> Duration: Weeks 4, 5 and 6

For the first challenge, you will be working individually primarily in simulation to solve a key part of the structural inspection path planning problem. Your task will be in investigating and implementing solutions to finding the most optimal way of visiting a series of locations representing inspection locations, while avoiding the obstacles in the environment. 

This mirrors real life autonomous inspection scenarios which are the majority of current day use cases with autonomous drones. 

Assessment details will be provided separately.

### Practical 6 (After reading week)
> Duration: Week 6 
<!-- > Week 7

In practical 3, we now introduce some more widely used systems within the drone ecosystem, namely the Pixhawk flight controller, PX4 flight control firmware stack and associated tools. The aim is to give some experience within systems which are more widely used in industry and research all over the world. 

In the session there will be a mix of software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation of drones using PX4 on Ubuntu, as well as hands on dissection of a small PX4 based quadcopter to understand the hardware setup. Hopefully by the end of the session we will be able to hook up the STIL with ROS2 and Aerostack2 -->

### Practical 7
> Duration: Week 7
 
### Practicals 8, 9 and 10 - CW2: Grand Challenge - Exploring Real-Life Drone Use Cases (Will show you soon)

<!-- > Weeks 8, 9 and 10

In the last few weeks, you will be working in teams to complete the grand challenge in which will choose a particular scenario and solve the problem using one or more drones with the tools we have shown you. Your team will emulate a start-up type setup as a primary deliverable will be a 4 minute pitch to deliver to a panel of investors demonstrating your solution. 

The scenarios available, team sizes and assessment criteria will be released closer to the time. -->
