# Practical 2: ROS2 with Aerostack2

In this second practical, we will quickly be jumping into the greater code ecosystem for drone work. We start by introducing Aerostack2 which is a ROS2 based framework for the control and coordination of one or more drones. 

This practical also includes an introduction to ubuntu and ROS2 if you havent already. It will also take you through a ROS2 installation suggestions for various platforms.
