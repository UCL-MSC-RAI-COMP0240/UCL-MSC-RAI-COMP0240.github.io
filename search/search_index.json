The Terminal Environment Variables and .bashrc Navigating the file system Working with files Installing Dependencies and Useful Programs Installing Git and VSCode sudo Installing Docker Common Linux Issues (Weeks 1\u20132) Permission Denied Errors Command Not Found Terminal Not Reflecting Changes Getting Help Effectively Assumed Background \u00b6 This course assumes that students are comfortable with: Basic programming (Python and/or C++) Using a terminal and command-line tools Editing configuration files Installing software using a package manager You are not expected to be an expert Linux user at the start of the course. However, you are expected to be able to follow technical documentation independently and to troubleshoot basic setup issues. Setting up and maintaining a functional development environment is considered part of the learning outcomes of this module. Tasks \u00b6 Install and Run Ubuntu 22.04 using your preferred method Familiarise yourself with Linux and Ubuntu Install the programs and applications you might find useful Install ROS2 and Gazebo Fortress In week 2 we will focus on installing Aerostack2. Further Tasks: Read the following to get the best introduction! LinuxJourney Linux Installation \u00b6 From this point onward, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the reference operating system for this course. All practicals, examples, and troubleshooting assume this environment. This choice reflects standard practice in robotics and aerial robotics research and industry. In particular, ROS 2 Humble and ROS 2-derived tools are most stable and best supported on Ubuntu 22.04. In previous iterations of this course we explored Windows and macOS (including Intel and Apple Silicon). These platforms introduced persistent challenges, including: Compatibility issues with ROS 2 and its dependencies Inconsistent performance and tooling availability Increased troubleshooting overhead for both students and instructors This ultimately reduced the quality and pace of the practical sessions. To maximise learning outcomes, the course now standardises on Ubuntu. Specific to macOS users, we offered a limited laptop scheme (subject to availability and need). Please contact the course instructors for further details. Supported Setup Options (Order of Preference) \u00b6 The following environments are supported, listed in order of preference: Native Ubuntu 22.04 Installation (Strongly Recommended) Best performance and lowest latency Full support for: ROS 2 Humble Gazebo simulation Aerostack2 USB-based hardware (e.g. Crazyradio) This setup is strongly recommended for students intending to participate in hardware-based practicals and challenges. Dual-Boot Ubuntu 22.04 (Supported) Ubuntu installed alongside an existing Windows installation Equivalent performance to a native installation when booted into Ubuntu Requires disk repartitioning and rebooting between operating systems Requires \u2265 100 GB of free disk space Ensure you have recorded your BitLocker account information to avoid issues! Supported by course instructors. Ubuntu 22.04 on an External SSD / NVMe Drive (Supported) Ubuntu installed on a portable USB-C SSD or NVMe drive Near-native performance Minimal changes to the host system Requires a fast USB-C port Ensure you have recorded your BitLocker account information to avoid issues! A limited number of pre-configured Ubuntu 22.04 external drives may be available to borrow (subject to availability). Primarily tested on Windows systems; macOS compatibility is not guaranteed. WSL 2 / Virtual Machines / Docker (Limited Support) These options are permitted but not recommended. For those are the interested in exploring, we are happy to provide feedback. Though expect having to solve specific software and device related problems. For this keen to take up this challenge, it is a option for learning advanced aspects of using Linux for robotics development. They may be suitable for: Learning Linux basics ROS 2 development Simulation-only work Known limitations include: Unreliable USB access Increased latency and timing jitter Reduced graphics performance for Gazebo and RViz Additional configuration overhead NOTE : Support from the course team for these setups will be limited, and students using them may not be able to complete hardware-dependent activities. While containers (e.g., Docker) and virtual machines (VMs) can offer flexibility, they have limitations in this context: Docker : Known for portability, but graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for simulation tools like Gazebo and RViz can be challenging to configure, especially on Windows. Virtual Machines : Simulations in Gazebo are graphics-intensive, and VMs often lack the hardware acceleration needed for smooth operation. Additionally, VMs can have limited access to host machine IO interfaces (e.g., USB), making hardware integration difficult. That said, students are welcome to experiment with Docker or VMs, but these methods will receive minimal support from the course instructors. Installing Ubuntu 22.04 \u00b6 For native, dual-boot, or external-drive installations: Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop ISO from: Ubuntu ISO Download Prepare a bootable USB drive (8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended) using a tool such as: Rufus (Windows) Balena Etcher Ventoy Insert the USB drive and reboot your machine. Enter the boot menu or BIOS/UEFI settings (key varies by manufacturer; commonly F12, Esc, or Del). Example (Dell): F2 \u2192 BIOS/UEFI F12 \u2192 Boot menu Go to bios setting to reorder your booting sequence. Different brands of computers have different ways of getting into bios. For example, for dell computer, you could access the BIOS/UEFI settings by restarting your computer and pressing the F2 key repeatedly as soon as the Dell logo appears. Lift the borrowed drive up to the first, then save changes. Now your computer will boot from this automatically as long as it is plugged into your computer. Boot from the USB drive and follow the Ubuntu installer. Choose to wipe the disk, dual-boot, or install to an external drive as appropriate. Important: Back up important data before installing or repartitioning disks. The course team cannot take responsibility for data loss due to OS installation. Also, for windows users, record and ensure you have access to your BitLocker account. A general dual-boot guide can be found here: Dual-Boot Guide (Optional) WSL2 Installation \u00b6 WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is permitted for this course with limitations. Based on our experience so far, it can be used for: - Learning Linux and ROS 2 - Software development - Simulation-only tasks It is not recommended for hardware-based practicals due to USB access complexity, latency, and non-deterministic timing. Therefore, support for WSL 2 will be limited. System Requirements: - Windows 10 (version 2004 / build 19041 or later) or Windows 11 - Administrator access on your machine - At least 16 GB system RAM recommended (8 GB minimum). By default, wsl2 allocates 50% of your systems resources. From our experience you need to set 24GB of memory to run the coursework. - When using WSL2 expect: - Increased latency compared to native Ubuntu - Reduced stability at high ROS 2 update rates - Gazebo performance may depend on compatible Windows vGPU drivers (you can force to run on CPU) - No native USB access USB devices (e.g. Crazyradio) require manual forwarding and may be unreliable. Install WSL 2 Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: wsl --install This will: - Enable WSL - Enable the Virtual Machine Platform - Install WSL 2 - Install a default Linux distribution Restart your machine when prompted. To ensure WSL 2 is being used: wsl --set-default-version 2 Install Ubuntu 22.04 Install Ubuntu 22.04 explicitly: wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04 Once installed, launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu. Update Ubuntu Inside the WSL Ubuntu terminal: sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Verify the version: lsb_release -a You should see Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Increasing WSL2 Memory and CPU allocation \u00b6 By default, WSL 2 dynamically allocates system resources. For ROS 2 and Gazebo, this often results in insufficient memory and poor performance. To overcome, you must manually configure resource limits. Create or Edit .wslconfig Open File Explorer Navigate to your Windows user directory: C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\ Create a new text file named: .wslconfig Ensure the file has no file extension Windows may try to name it .wslconfig.txt (this is incorrect) Configure Resource Limits Open .wslconfig using Notepad or VS Code and paste the following: [wsl2] memory=24GB processors=20 swap=8GB localhostForwarding=true Above values are based on our experience, please adjust values based on your hardware. Restart WSL wsl --shutdown Verify Resource Allocation -In Ubuntu, check memory allocation: free -h Check processors: nproc Other Methods if you want to explore - Docker / Virtual Machine (Advanced and Limited Course Support) \u00b6 The following options are not recommended as primary setups, but may be explored by students who are experienced with Linux systems and understand the associated limitations. Support from the course team for these methods will be limited. Repurpose an old laptop If you have access to an older laptop, you may choose to: Wipe the machine and install Ubuntu 22.04 directly Use it as a dedicated Linux development machine for the course This approach can work well provided the hardware supports: - Reasonable CPU performance - At least 16 GB RAM - Basic GPU acceleration for Gazebo Docker Docker may be useful in specific, controlled situations, but it is not a primary supported workflow for this module. Known issues include: - Docker may be possible for some of the situations - Known issues with GUIs and Windows (which can be solved) - Not as supported Quick Linux Reference Guide \u00b6 Adapted from this digital ocean tutorial . This section provides a concise, course-specific reference to Linux concepts and commands required for COMP0240. It is not intended to be a comprehensive Linux tutorial. What is Linux? \u00b6 Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel (core operating system). Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others. The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world\u2019s smartphones are powered by Linux. However, newcomers to Linux may find it somewhat difficult to approach, as Linux filesystems have a different structure than those found on Windows or MacOS. Additionally, Linux-based operating systems depend heavily on working with the command line interface, while most personal computers rely on graphical interfaces. The Terminal \u00b6 In Linux, most development and system interaction occurs via the terminal. The terms \u201cterminal,\u201d \u201cshell,\u201d and \u201ccommand line interface\u201d are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them: A terminal is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell. A shell is a program that exposes the computer\u2019s operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter. The default shell in Ubuntu Linux is known as bash . A command line interface is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results. When someone refers to one of these three terms in the context of Linux, they generally mean a terminal environment where you can run commands and see the results printed out to the terminal, such as this: There are two ways to open a terminal: Pressing the Win or Cmd key to open the program menu and typing terminal , then pressing Enter Pressing Ctrl + Alt + T This default terminal is known as the 'gnome-terminal'. Other terminals exist such as 'terminator' Becoming a Linux user requires you to be comfortable with using a terminal. Any administrative task, including file manipulation, package installation, and user management, can be accomplished through the terminal. The terminal is interactive: you specify commands to run (after the $ sign) and the terminal outputs the results of those commands. To execute any command, you type it into the prompt and press Enter . Most ROS 2 workflows (building packages, launching nodes, sourcing environments) are executed from the terminal. Although personal computers that run Linux often come with the kind of graphical desktop environment familiar to most computer users, it is often more efficient or practical to perform certain tasks through commands entered into the terminal. Environment Variables and .bashrc \u00b6 The shell uses environment variables to control how programs are found and executed. For example, when you run a command, bash searches for the executable using the PATH variable: echo $PATH A basic command to try out is echo , which will print things to the terminal. For example echo hello-world will print hello-world into the terminal. You can also use it to observe the value of Environment Variables which record and keep useful variables to the operation of the Operating System. For example, when you run a command in bash , bash will look for the command executable in the locations provided by the environment variable PATH . You can print the contents of this env-var using echo $PATH . The $ before the name of the variable tells bash that the following word represents an environment variable, and that it should be looked up. Note that for the default shell option of bash , there is often a way of specifying an environment (i.e. a set of variables, defaults etc) that your particular terminal shell interface is running. For bash, these defaults are defined inside of the .bashrc file found in your home directory. If we want defaults to be set, we add them in here - this becomes useful in many applications including ROS2. User-specific shell configuration is stored in: ~/.bashrc In this course, .bashrc is commonly used to: - Source ROS 2 environments - Set environment variables - Configure development tools After modifying .bashrc, apply changes with: source ~/.bashrc Navigating the file system \u00b6 Like Windows and Mac, the Linux filesystems are based on a directory tree. This means that you can create directories (which are functionally identical to folders found in other operating systems) inside other directories, and files can exist in any directory. The forward slash ( / ) is used to indicate the root directory in the filesystem hierarchy. When a user logs in to the shell, they are brought to their own user directory, stored within /home/<username> . This is referred to as the user\u2019s home directory. Often you may see the tilde ( ~ ) character when specifying a file location (e.g. ~/Documents/hello.txt = /home/<username>/Documents/hello.txt ). This is shorthand for the user's home directory and gets substituted in when used. To see what directory you are currently active in you can run the pwd command, which stands for \u201cprint working directory\u201d myuser@my-machine:~$ pwd /home/myuser To see a list of files and directories that exist in your current working directory, run the ls command: myuser@my-machine:~$ ls Desktop Documents Downloads Pictures Public Wallpapers You can get more details if you run ls -al command: myuser@my-machine:~$ ls -al drwxr-xr-x 2 myuser myuser 4096 Apr 30 2021 Desktop drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Oct 29 09:27 Documents drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Dec 10 14:41 Downloads drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 May 23 10:43 Pictures drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Jan 19 2017 Public drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Oct 15 09:43 Wallpapers You can create one or more new directories within your current working directory with the mkdir command, which stands for \u201cmake directory\u201d. For example, to create two new directories named testdir1 and testdir2, you might run the first command. You can create nested directories by using the -p option: myuser@my-machine:~$ mkdir testdir1 testdir2 myuser@my-machine:~$ mkdir -p testdir3/testsubdir To navigate into one of these new directories, run the cd command (which stands for \u201cchange directory\u201d) and specify the directory\u2019s name: myuser@my-machine:~$ cd testdir1 myuser@my-machine:~/testdir1$ Note that you can navigate from anywhere to anywhere. cd only requires a valid filepath. Note also that . represents the current folder and .. represents the parent folder. Note also how is shows the current working directory in the shell as well. cd # This will bring you back to home directory cd testdir3/testsubdir # Brings you into testsubdir cd ../ # Brings you back out one level into testdir3 cd ../testdir1 # Brings you back out one level and back into testdir1 cd /home/<username>/testdir2 # Absolute reference to testdir2 cd ~/testdir2 # Absolute reference using tilde to testdir2 Working with files \u00b6 You cannot use cd to interact with files; cd stands for \u201cchange directory\u201d, and only allows you to navigate directories. You can, however, create, edit, and view the contents of files. One way to create a file is with the touch command. This creates an empty file in your current working directory. To create a new file called file.txt: touch file.txt If you decide to rename file.txt later on, you can do so with the mv command. mv stands for \u201cmove\u201d and it can move a file or directory from one place to another. By specifying the original file, file.txt, you can \u201cmove\u201d it to a new location in the current working directory, thereby renaming it. mv file.txt newfile.txt It is also possible to copy a file to a new location with the cp command. If we want to copy newfile.txt, you can make a copy of newfile.txt named newfile_copy.txt like this: cp newfile.txt newfile_copy.txt However, files are not of much use if they don\u2019t contain anything. To edit files, a file editor is necessary. There are many options for file editors, all created by professionals for daily use. Such editors include vim, emacs, nano, and pico. nano is a suitable option for beginners: it is relatively user-friendly and doesn\u2019t overload you with cryptic options or commands. nano file.txt This will open a space where you can start typing to edit the file. In nano specifically you can save your written text by pressing Ctrl + X , Y , and then Enter . This returns you to the shell with a newly saved file.txt . Now that file.txt has some text within it, you can view it using cat or less . The cat command prints the contents of a specified file to your system\u2019s output. Try running cat and pass the file.txt file you just edited as an argument: cat file.txt Using cat to view file contents can be unwieldy and difficult to read if the file is particularly long. As an alternative, you can use the less command which will allow you to paginate the output. Use less to view the contents of the file.txt file, like this: less file.txt This will also print the contents of file.txt, but one terminal page at a time beginning at the start of the file. You can use the spacebar to advance a page, or the arrow keys to go up and down one line at a time. Press Q to quit out of less . Finally, to delete the file.txt file, pass the name of the file as an argument to rm : rm file.txt # delete a file rmdir directory # delete an empty directory rm -r directory # delete a non-empty directory (destructive) NOTE : If your question has to do with a specific Linux command, the manual pages offer detailed and insightful documentation for nearly every command. To see the man page for any command, pass the command\u2019s name as an argument to the man command - man command . Warning: rm -r permanently deletes files and directories. Use with care. For instance, man rm displays the purpose of rm , how to use it, what options are available, examples of use, and more useful information. NOTE : If a command fails or is hanging or you just want to stop it, most of the time you can stop the running process by pressing Ctrl + C . This will send a Keyboard Interrupt message to the program and hopefully stop it. Installing Dependencies and Useful Programs \u00b6 Like windows and mac, individual programs can be manually downloaded (usually as a tar.gz file instead of exe ) and manually installed into your operating system (using dpkg ). However, the linux project offers a much more straight forward method through the apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) utility. apt is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian operating systems like Ubuntu. (For other distributions you may come across equivalents like yum ). This is the primary method for installing software onto your system. To use apt , and more specifically apt-get which 'gets' programs for you, you must first run the update command to get the current list of all available software. Note that because sudo is used, you will most likely need to input your password. sudo will be explained below. sudo apt update Note that it will hang (stop responding) or fail if you are not connected to the internet. Installing Git and VSCode \u00b6 You can then install your programs using apt install . For this course, you will need to use the git version control software. To install git , run the following: sudo apt install git We also recommend the use of Visual Studio Code as your development environment or text editor, but you are free to use whatever you want (atom, notepad++ etc etc). We heavily make use of it during development and recommend a number of extensions. VScode can be installed using the snap utility. snap is a slightly more modern successor to apt for more general programs. snap comes ready installed on your linux distrubtion. sudo snap install code --classic sudo \u00b6 Now in these commands, we have prefixed all of them with sudo . sudo these days usually stands for superuser do and allows a command to be run with the privileges of the superuser (aka the root user), if the user has been given permissions to do so. Any command which installs or modifies directories outside of the users home directory will often need superuser privileges to avoid non-superusers from changing things they shouldn't. As the above commands all seek to install programs to the system, they need superuser permissions to do so. Running without sudo will give you a permission error. Running a command with sudo will ask you for your own accounts password. Installing Docker \u00b6 For Linux systems, see the following install page . There are multiple ways of installation docker, but we recommend installing using the repository method: Update the apt repository and install requirements sudo apt update sudo apt install \\ apt-transport-https \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg \\ lsb-release Add Docker's official GPG key: curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg Add Docker's repository: echo \\ \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null Install Docker (and docker-compose!): sudo apt update sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io Test Docker installation: sudo docker run hello-world This will install Docker, accessible using sudo root privileges only. To use docker without sudo, run the following (there are security issues ) Run the following sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Log out and log in again to enforce changes Verify that it was successful (we will come back to this command): docker run hello-world That is Docker on Linux installed. See the original page for any further details. Common Linux Issues (Weeks 1\u20132) \u00b6 The following issues are commonly encountered during the first two weeks: Permission Denied Errors \u00b6 If a command fails due to permissions, check whether it requires sudo . Command Not Found \u00b6 This usually indicates that the required package is not installed or that the environment has not been sourced correctly. Terminal Not Reflecting Changes \u00b6 After editing ~/.bashrc , always apply the changes using: bash source ~/.bashrc Getting Help Effectively \u00b6 Before asking for help, ensure you have: - Read the error message carefully - Checked the relevant section of this guide - Attempted to search the error message verbatim When requesting help, include: - The full error output - Your operating system and setup method - The command you ran","title":"2.

Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others. The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world\u2019s smartphones are powered by Linux. However, newcomers to Linux may find it somewhat difficult to approach, as Linux filesystems have a different structure than those found on Windows or MacOS. Additionally, Linux-based operating systems depend heavily on working with the command line interface, while most personal computers rely on graphical interfaces.","title":"What is Linux?"},{"location":"1b_intro_linux/#the-terminal","text":"In Linux, most development and system interaction occurs via the terminal. The terms \u201cterminal,\u201d \u201cshell,\u201d and \u201ccommand line interface\u201d are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them: A terminal is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell. A shell is a program that exposes the computer\u2019s operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter. The default shell in Ubuntu Linux is known as bash . A command line interface is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results. When someone refers to one of these three terms in the context of Linux, they generally mean a terminal environment where you can run commands and see the results printed out to the terminal, such as this: There are two ways to open a terminal: Pressing the Win or Cmd key to open the program menu and typing terminal , then pressing Enter Pressing Ctrl + Alt + T This default terminal is known as the 'gnome-terminal'. Other terminals exist such as 'terminator' Becoming a Linux user requires you to be comfortable with using a terminal. Any administrative task, including file manipulation, package installation, and user management, can be accomplished through the terminal. The terminal is interactive: you specify commands to run (after the $ sign) and the terminal outputs the results of those commands. To execute any command, you type it into the prompt and press Enter . Most ROS 2 workflows (building packages, launching nodes, sourcing environments) are executed from the terminal. Although personal computers that run Linux often come with the kind of graphical desktop environment familiar to most computer users, it is often more efficient or practical to perform certain tasks through commands entered into the terminal.","title":"The Terminal"},{"location":"1b_intro_linux/#environment-variables-and-bashrc","text":"The shell uses environment variables to control how programs are found and executed. For example, when you run a command, bash searches for the executable using the PATH variable: echo $PATH A basic command to try out is echo , which will print things to the terminal. For example echo hello-world will print hello-world into the terminal. You can also use it to observe the value of Environment Variables which record and keep useful variables to the operation of the Operating System. For example, when you run a command in bash , bash will look for the command executable in the locations provided by the environment variable PATH . You can print the contents of this env-var using echo $PATH . The $ before the name of the variable tells bash that the following word represents an environment variable, and that it should be looked up. Note that for the default shell option of bash , there is often a way of specifying an environment (i.e. a set of variables, defaults etc) that your particular terminal shell interface is running. For bash, these defaults are defined inside of the .bashrc file found in your home directory. If we want defaults to be set, we add them in here - this becomes useful in many applications including ROS2. User-specific shell configuration is stored in: ~/.bashrc In this course, .bashrc is commonly used to: - Source ROS 2 environments - Set environment variables - Configure development tools After modifying .bashrc, apply changes with: source ~/.bashrc","title":"Environment Variables and .bashrc"},{"location":"1b_intro_linux/#navigating-the-file-system","text":"Like Windows and Mac, the Linux filesystems are based on a directory tree. This means that you can create directories (which are functionally identical to folders found in other operating systems) inside other directories, and files can exist in any directory. The forward slash ( / ) is used to indicate the root directory in the filesystem hierarchy. When a user logs in to the shell, they are brought to their own user directory, stored within /home/<username> . This is referred to as the user\u2019s home directory. Often you may see the tilde ( ~ ) character when specifying a file location (e.g. ~/Documents/hello.txt = /home/<username>/Documents/hello.txt ). This is shorthand for the user's home directory and gets substituted in when used. To see what directory you are currently active in you can run the pwd command, which stands for \u201cprint working directory\u201d myuser@my-machine:~$ pwd /home/myuser To see a list of files and directories that exist in your current working directory, run the ls command: myuser@my-machine:~$ ls Desktop Documents Downloads Pictures Public Wallpapers You can get more details if you run ls -al command: myuser@my-machine:~$ ls -al drwxr-xr-x 2 myuser myuser 4096 Apr 30 2021 Desktop drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Oct 29 09:27 Documents drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Dec 10 14:41 Downloads drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 May 23 10:43 Pictures drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Jan 19 2017 Public drwxrwxr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Oct 15 09:43 Wallpapers You can create one or more new directories within your current working directory with the mkdir command, which stands for \u201cmake directory\u201d. For example, to create two new directories named testdir1 and testdir2, you might run the first command. You can create nested directories by using the -p option: myuser@my-machine:~$ mkdir testdir1 testdir2 myuser@my-machine:~$ mkdir -p testdir3/testsubdir To navigate into one of these new directories, run the cd command (which stands for \u201cchange directory\u201d) and specify the directory\u2019s name: myuser@my-machine:~$ cd testdir1 myuser@my-machine:~/testdir1$ Note that you can navigate from anywhere to anywhere. cd only requires a valid filepath. Note also that . represents the current folder and .. represents the parent folder. Note also how is shows the current working directory in the shell as well. cd # This will bring you back to home directory cd testdir3/testsubdir # Brings you into testsubdir cd ../ # Brings you back out one level into testdir3 cd ../testdir1 # Brings you back out one level and back into testdir1 cd /home/<username>/testdir2 # Absolute reference to testdir2 cd ~/testdir2 # Absolute reference using tilde to testdir2","title":"Navigating the file system"},{"location":"1b_intro_linux/#working-with-files","text":"You cannot use cd to interact with files; cd stands for \u201cchange directory\u201d, and only allows you to navigate directories.

To create a new file called file.txt: touch file.txt If you decide to rename file.txt later on, you can do so with the mv command. mv stands for \u201cmove\u201d and it can move a file or directory from one place to another.

To edit files, a file editor is necessary. There are many options for file editors, all created by professionals for daily use. Such editors include vim, emacs, nano, and pico. nano is a suitable option for beginners: it is relatively user-friendly and doesn\u2019t overload you with cryptic options or commands. nano file.txt This will open a space where you can start typing to edit the file. In nano specifically you can save your written text by pressing Ctrl + X , Y , and then Enter . This returns you to the shell with a newly saved file.txt .

Try running cat and pass the file.txt file you just edited as an argument: cat file.txt Using cat to view file contents can be unwieldy and difficult to read if the file is particularly long. As an alternative, you can use the less command which will allow you to paginate the output.

If you are using WSL 2 or a virtualised environment, ensure this is configured correctly before proceeding. For full installation details, refer to the official documentation: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html Update your system: sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade # Check and set the locale to UTF-8 locale sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 locale # Verify settings # Install required packages sudo apt install software-properties-common sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions sudo add-apt-repository universe sudo apt update sudo apt install curl -y # Download and add the ROS2 GPG key sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg # Add the ROS2 repository to your sources list echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null You will need to install both the desktop and build tools sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop sudo apt install ros-dev-tools Environment Configuration - Source ROS2 Automatically \u00b6 ROS2 relies on environment setup. If this step is incorrect, ROS commands will not function. To do this, it is recommended that you add the startup script to your ~/.bashrc script Open .bashrc and edit the file nano ~/.bashrc The bashrc file should have been opened, then scroll to bottom of bashrc and append the following to the end, save ( Ctrl+O ) and exit ( Ctrl+X ) source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash This will ensure that ROS2 is auto-enabled for all terminals which you setup. Ensure your system uses UTF-8, install the required packages, and add the official ROS2 repository. You can also edit .bashrc in the terminal without opening the file. This will add new entries to the bottom of the file. -Restrict ROS communication to the local machine (recommended for teaching labs): echo 'export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1' >> ~/.bashrc -Apply the changes: source ~/.bashrc -Verify: ros2 --version Expected output should reference humble. Note : In our tutorials please set ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 otherwise everybody's ROS traffic will interfere with everybody else in the class! Outside of class we would usually segregate ROS traffic only its own network to avoid interference. Installing Ignition Gazebo Fortress \u00b6 Gazebo is the simulation environment that is most often used with ROS2. There are many different versions of gazebo - for us we are using the new version designed for Ubuntu 22.04 known as Gazebo Fortress. The recommended compatible gazebo version for Ubuntu 22.04 and Humble is Fortress where installation instructions are here . But in short: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install lsb-release wget gnupg sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ignition-fortress You can check succesful installation by using the ign cli command A Brief Introduction to ROS \u00b6 This section is adapted from this article ROS stands for the Robot Operating System, yet it isn't an actual operating system. It's a framework designed to expedite the development time of robot platforms. To understand what ROS is, we should understand why ROS exists in the first place. Why does ROS exist? \u00b6 In general, software developers avoid hardware like the plague. It's messy, doesn't have consistent behavior, and there's no ctrl-z in sight. Most beginner programmers think you have to have a deep knowledge of electronics and even mechanics to program robots. They think that the hardware and software are so tightly coupled, you have to know both in depth to build anything useful. Software developers became software developers for a reason, so they don't have to deal with hardware. For example, let's say you have to debug a faulty sensor. You first have to take out the sensor from the enclosure, test the sensor thoroughly with a multi meter and various test cases, document its behavior, then examine the hardware -level code to ensure that there were no bugs, and so on. That's a lot of interaction with the hardware that's not fun for someone who just wants to write some cool software. It's harder to attract good programmers if the programming is coupled deeply with hardware. This is where ROS comes into play. With ROS, you can completely abstract the hardware from software, and instead interact with an API that gives access to that data. You can forget about the hardware, and focus on developing the software that makes the robot do what you want. What is ROS \u00b6 ROS is essentially a framework that sits on top of an operating system which defines how particular ROS compatible programs communicate and share data with each other. Essentially ROS defines an interface between which compatible programs can communicate and interact with each other. Over the years that ROS has existed, many people have developed thousands of ROS compatible packages which can be used in a modular fashion. ROS concepts through an example \u00b6 To make it more concrete, imagine that on your drone you have a camera. There are also two processes which require, as inputs, that camera image. Say, a machine learning program, and a position estimation program. Traditionally, you would have to manually serialise (compress) and stream the image over a port which the other two programs could read from. But if the port changes or, say, the camera changes, lots of things have to be reconfigured. However, this sort of interaction can be made streamlined in ROS. Let us consider the programs we have as ROS nodes , i.e. a program which is responsible for one single modular purpose, with particular inputs or outputs: A camera image streaming node OUT: camera image A machine vision system for recognising objects IN: camera image OUT: list of recognised objects A simultaneous localisation and mapping system. IN: camera image OUT: vehicle position These outputs of a node define ROS topics , i.e. a single stream of one type of data. Each topic has a particular name which can be referred to. In our example, some of the topics might be: /drone/camera for the camera image /drone/recognised_objects for the machine vision system /drone/slam_position for the SLAM system Then, we see that there are two avenues of communication created from these node inputs and outputs. graph LR A[Camera] -->|out| node[drone/camera] node --in--> C[Machine Vision] node --in--> D[SLAM] style node fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px Now ROS follows a publisher/subscriber model of communication. What that means is that nodes publish data to topics as outputs. But that data is only sent across the network if a different nodes also subscribes to the same topic. So in our example we end up having A camera image streaming node OUT: publishing to /drone/camera A machine vision system for recognising objects IN: subscribed to /drone/camera OUT: publishing to /drone/recognised_objects A simultaneous localisation and mapping system. IN: subscribed to /drone/camera OUT: publishing to /drone/slam_position graph LR A[Camera] -->|out| node[drone/camera] node --in--> C[Vision] C -->|out| node1[drone/recognised_objects] node --in--> D[SLAM] D -->|out| node2[drone/slam_position] style node fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style node1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style node2 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px Finally, the data that is sent is not just anything. The data or message is a specifically templated packet of data containing things specified for that paricular use case. In our example for /drone/slam_position topic, the message might be of type geometry_msgs/msg/Point.msg which is defined like so: # This contains the position of a point in free space float64 x float64 y float64 z In other words the message that the /drone/slam_position topic publishes must have a msg.x , msg.y and msg.z field, and the subscriber will only receivea message with those fields. There are a number of messages in the standard ROS library, but many libraries also define their own - as have we in some parts of Starling. This can be summarised in this diagram from the ROS tutorials demonstrates it very nicely: The bottom half of this shows how topics get sent from a publisher to a subscriber. Interestingly, if you put two topics together, you get some notion of two way communication. This is the basis of a service which can be seen in the top of the diagram. A service is made of a Request topic and a Response topic, but functions as a single communication type to the user. Similar to messages, a service has a defined request and response types (e.g. see std_srvs/srv/SetBool.srv ). A service request will often wait until a response is received before continuing. Then if you combine two services and a topic, you can imitate a request for something which takes time. This in ROS is known as an action . For example requesting a robot to move from one location to another. You first request the move, which you get a response as to whether its started. This is followed by constant feedback along a particular topic. Then ended with a task complete service response. In this a whole set of messages are defined. Note that everything happens asyncronously and in parallel, when a node subscribes or sends a requests, it doesn't know when the response will arrive. It only knows it will (hopefully) arrive at some point. When a packet is received the subscriber can then run a method - this method is usually known as a callback , but that will be covered in a later tutorial. Finally, each node is configured by a set of parameters which are broadcast to all other nodes. Parameters are often configuration values for particular methods in a node, and can sometimes be changed on startup (or dynamically through a service), to allow the node to provide adjustable functionality. For example the value of a timeout or frequency of a loop. So in summary, the key concepts and terminology are: Nodes Topics Publishers and Subscribers Messages Services Actions Parameters ROS2 vs ROS1 \u00b6 There are 2 versions of ROS: ROS1 and ROS2. ROS1, initially created in 2007 by Willow Garage, has become huge among the open source robotics community. However over the years they realised that there are a number of important features which are missing - and adding all of these would simply break ROS1. Also the most recent ROS1 distribution (ROS Noetic) is soon to reach the end of its supported life (EOL 2025) with no more ROS1 there after! (See this article for more details!) Therefore, to future proof the system, and to ensure all users get a well rounded experience that will hopefully translate to industry experience, Starling has been implemented in ROS2. Specifically, this tutorial uses the Humble Hawksbill (AKA Humble) Long Term Support (LTS) distribution throughout. There are some interesting changes between ROS1 and ROS2, but the core elements described above remain identical. For those interested, ROS2 follows a much more decentralised paradigm, and does not require a central ROSnode as it uses the distributed DDS communication protocol for its internal communication. All nodes therefore broadcast their own topics allowing for easy decentralised discovery - perfect for multi-robot applications. Note: Main thing to be aware of is if you are debugging and searching for ROS questions on the internet, be aware that there are many existing questions for ROS1 which will no longer apply for ROS2. ROS2 in Practice - Workflow Concepts \u00b6 In this course, to recap, ROS2 should be understood as a distributed software framework that allows multiple processes to communicate in a structured and inspectable way. Rather than treating ROS2 as a black box, you are expected to understand how to observe and reason about a running system. The concepts below are the minimum required to develop, debug, and extend ROS2-based systems. Nodes \u00b6 A node is an executable process that performs computation. In practice, nodes typically implement: - perception (e.g. sensor processing) - estimation (e.g. localisation) - control (e.g. flight commands) - coordination and logic Each node runs independently and communicates with other nodes using ROS2 communication primitives. Common inspection commands: ros2 node list ros2 node info /node_name Use these to: - confirm a node has launched successfully - check which topics, services, and parameters a node uses - diagnose crashes or missing functionality Topics \u00b6 Topics Topics are asynchronous data streams used for continuous data flow. Typical examples include: - sensor measurements - state estimates - control commands Topics follow a publish\u2013subscribe model: - publishers send messages - subscribers receive messages - communication is decoupled and non-blocking Common inspection commands: ros2 topic list ros2 topic echo /topic_name ros2 topic hz /topic_name Use topics to: - verify that data is being produced - inspect message values in real time - confirm expected update rates If a robot appears unresponsive, checking topics is often the first debugging step. Services \u00b6 Services provide synchronous, request\u2013response communication. Unlike topics, services: block until a response is received are typically used for discrete actions Common uses include: - enabling or disabling controllers - resetting systems - switching operating modes Inspection commands: ros2 service list ros2 service type /service_name ros2 service call /service_name <service_type> <request> Services are particularly useful for testing system behaviour interactively. Parameters \u00b6 Parameters are runtime configuration values associated with nodes. They allow you to modify system behaviour without recompiling code. Typical uses: - controller gains - thresholds and limits - enabling or disabling features Inspection commands: ros2 param list ros2 param get /node_name parameter_name ros2 param set /node_name parameter_name value Parameters are a key mechanism for tuning aerial robotics systems during experimentation. Launching ROS2 Systems \u00b6 Realistic robotics systems consist of multiple nodes that must be started in a coordinated way. ROS2 uses launch files to manage this process. A launch file typically: - starts multiple nodes - sets parameters - configures namespaces and remappings - controls logging and output Example: ros2 launch <package_name> <launch_file>.py When using launch files: - always monitor terminal output - warnings and errors often indicate misconfiguration - a successful launch does not guarantee correct behaviour Learning to read and interpret launch output is an essential skill. Debugging Workflow \u00b6 When a ROS2 system does not behave as expected, debugging should be systematic, not trial-and-error. Use the following workflow as your first response: 1: Check the Environment echo $ROS_DISTRO Ensure the correct ROS distribution is sourced. Check Node Execution ros2 node list If a node is missing: - it may have failed to launch - it may have crashed - it may not be included in the launch file 3: Check Data Flow ros2 topic list ros2 topic echo /topic_name Confirm: - expected topics exist - messages are being published - values are reasonable 4: Check Parameters ros2 param list Incorrect or missing parameters are a common source of failures. 5: Inspect Logs ls log/ Logs often contain detailed error messages not visible in the terminal. This workflow resolves the majority of ROS-related issues encountered in this module. Common ROS2 Issues \u00b6 ROS Commands Not Found Cause: - ROS environment not sourced Symptom: ros2: command not found Fix: source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash Nodes Cannot Communicate Cause: network interference (VPNs, firewalls) incorrect DDS configuration Fix: - disable VPNs - ensure ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 is set for lab work Workspace Changes Have No Effect Cause: workspace not rebuilt workspace not sourced Fix: colcon build source install/setup.bash Silent Failures Cause: node crashes after launch launch file continues running Fix: - carefully inspect terminal output - check log files Recommended Development Practices \u00b6 To work efficiently with ROS2: - Treat ROS tools as diagnostic instruments - Build and test incrementally - Use multiple terminals: - one for launching systems - one or more for inspection Keep workspaces minimal and organised Avoid unnecessary complexity early on These practices reflect how ROS2 is used in both research and industry settings. About Gazebo \u00b6 Gazebo Fortress is a powerful and widely used open-source robotics simulation tool that allows developers and researchers to test, design, and validate their robots in virtual environments before deploying them in the real world. It provides a highly realistic simulation environment, complete with accurate physics, sensor emulation, and 3D visualization. Gazebo Fortress is the latest release in the Gazebo simulation suite, offering enhanced features such as improved physics engines, better integration with ROS2, and support for multi-robot systems. Students can use Gazebo to simulate everything from autonomous drones navigating complex environments to robotic arms performing precision tasks, all without the risk of damaging physical hardware. One of its standout features is the ability to create custom worlds and robots, making it a versatile tool for exploring robotics concepts and conducting experiments. Gazebo\u2019s tight integration with ROS2 also allows students to seamlessly test ROS2-based algorithms and systems within the simulator, bridging the gap between virtual testing and real-world implementation. Technically, Gazebo operates as a standalone simulation engine but shares key concepts with ROS2, including the use of the publish-subscribe architecture . In Gazebo, simulation components such as sensors, robots, and environmental factors communicate through topics, similar to ROS2 nodes. This allows for seamless integration between ROS2 and Gazebo, where ROS2 nodes can subscribe to Gazebo topics (e.g., sensor data) or publish commands (e.g., velocity or actuator inputs). The system we use in this course makes heavy use of Gazebo as the simulation platform for drone activities to enable development. It will not be likely that you will interact with Gazebo direcly, and instead through a ROS2 interface, however having some context is useful!","title":"3.

Interestingly, if you put two topics together, you get some notion of two way communication. This is the basis of a service which can be seen in the top of the diagram. A service is made of a Request topic and a Response topic, but functions as a single communication type to the user. Similar to messages, a service has a defined request and response types (e.g. see std_srvs/srv/SetBool.srv ). A service request will often wait until a response is received before continuing. Then if you combine two services and a topic, you can imitate a request for something which takes time. This in ROS is known as an action . For example requesting a robot to move from one location to another. You first request the move, which you get a response as to whether its started. This is followed by constant feedback along a particular topic. Then ended with a task complete service response. In this a whole set of messages are defined. Note that everything happens asyncronously and in parallel, when a node subscribes or sends a requests, it doesn't know when the response will arrive. It only knows it will (hopefully) arrive at some point. When a packet is received the subscriber can then run a method - this method is usually known as a callback , but that will be covered in a later tutorial. Finally, each node is configured by a set of parameters which are broadcast to all other nodes. Parameters are often configuration values for particular methods in a node, and can sometimes be changed on startup (or dynamically through a service), to allow the node to provide adjustable functionality. For example the value of a timeout or frequency of a loop. So in summary, the key concepts and terminology are: Nodes Topics Publishers and Subscribers Messages Services Actions Parameters","title":"ROS concepts through an example"},{"location":"1c_intro_ros2/#ros2-vs-ros1","text":"There are 2 versions of ROS: ROS1 and ROS2. ROS1, initially created in 2007 by Willow Garage, has become huge among the open source robotics community. However over the years they realised that there are a number of important features which are missing - and adding all of these would simply break ROS1. Also the most recent ROS1 distribution (ROS Noetic) is soon to reach the end of its supported life (EOL 2025) with no more ROS1 there after! (See this article for more details!) Therefore, to future proof the system, and to ensure all users get a well rounded experience that will hopefully translate to industry experience, Starling has been implemented in ROS2. Specifically, this tutorial uses the Humble Hawksbill (AKA Humble) Long Term Support (LTS) distribution throughout. There are some interesting changes between ROS1 and ROS2, but the core elements described above remain identical. For those interested, ROS2 follows a much more decentralised paradigm, and does not require a central ROSnode as it uses the distributed DDS communication protocol for its internal communication. All nodes therefore broadcast their own topics allowing for easy decentralised discovery - perfect for multi-robot applications. Note: Main thing to be aware of is if you are debugging and searching for ROS questions on the internet, be aware that there are many existing questions for ROS1 which will no longer apply for ROS2.","title":"ROS2 vs ROS1"},{"location":"1c_intro_ros2/#ros2-in-practice-workflow-concepts","text":"In this course, to recap, ROS2 should be understood as a distributed software framework that allows multiple processes to communicate in a structured and inspectable way.

Gazebo Fortress is the latest release in the Gazebo simulation suite, offering enhanced features such as improved physics engines, better integration with ROS2, and support for multi-robot systems. Students can use Gazebo to simulate everything from autonomous drones navigating complex environments to robotic arms performing precision tasks, all without the risk of damaging physical hardware. One of its standout features is the ability to create custom worlds and robots, making it a versatile tool for exploring robotics concepts and conducting experiments. Gazebo\u2019s tight integration with ROS2 also allows students to seamlessly test ROS2-based algorithms and systems within the simulator, bridging the gap between virtual testing and real-world implementation. Technically, Gazebo operates as a standalone simulation engine but shares key concepts with ROS2, including the use of the publish-subscribe architecture . In Gazebo, simulation components such as sensors, robots, and environmental factors communicate through topics, similar to ROS2 nodes. This allows for seamless integration between ROS2 and Gazebo, where ROS2 nodes can subscribe to Gazebo topics (e.g., sensor data) or publish commands (e.g., velocity or actuator inputs). The system we use in this course makes heavy use of Gazebo as the simulation platform for drone activities to enable development.

Flying \u00b6 The instructor will first check all is good with your drone and you have a good setup before you fly. Note: A batery only has around 5 minutes of flying time - keep an eye on it and swap it out if necessary. Just like being introduced to any new drone, you will first try to get a feel for how the drone will react to your control. Here is a list of actions you can go through to check and learn how your drone flies. Arming only test - In this test you will simply arm, wait a second, and then disarm he drone - you will not move the sticks. When you arm the drone, the motors will start spinning at minimum RPM, but not takeoff or otherwise move. Disarming the drone will then stop the motors. Does the drone arm and disarm again straight after without needing a restart Arming ESTOP test - In this test you will familiarise yourself with, and ensure that the emergency stop button works. Arm the drone and then press the estop. The motors should stop and the GUI should show emergency stop has been pressed. Floor thrust test - In this test you will start to familiarise yourself with the thrust control of the controller and response from the drone. You will want to gently increase the thrust, and you should start to see the drone looking like it wants to get off the ground. Try and get a feel for its response! Also worth noting if the drone appears to pivot to one side instead of thrusting equally from all four motors - you may need to compensate a little using the yaw and pitch. Gentle Takeoff and Landing - In this test you will attempt to have the drone takeoff and gently land in a controlled fashion. Building upon the previous, you should gently increase thrust until the drone leaves the ground. When it leaves the ground, try and hold the right thrust level if you can, otherwise reduce the thrust and try and land softly on the ground. Important A lot of beginner flyers will jerk the stick when it takes off - either plunging it into the ceiling or floor. Try to avoid this by holding your nerve and staying in control. If you feel out of control hit the ESTOP Landing Tip - Thust up a little bit just before you hit the floor, this will reduce the impact on the drone. Hovering - Once you are happy and in control with takeoff and landing, you should try and hold the hover for longer, correcting for horizontal drift using the roll/pitch correction. If you feel out of control hit the ESTOP Controlled Flight (no yaw)- Hopefully at this point you should be feeling a lot more in control of the drone (but you probably need a bit of practice!). Now try and slowly fly some shapes (square, circle etc) with the drone always facing away from you (no yaw). Controlled Flight - Now try flying the same shapes, but this time using yaw instead of rolling, i.e. always facing in the direction you want to move. It is recommended you try this by first yawing on the spot then moving forward. When you get more confident, you will be able to yaw while moving - this is the closest you'll get to FPV flying in this course! If working in a pair, don't forget to swap over! You may have noticed in the GUI and on the control scheme, there is a button labelled Assist Mode this will perform an automatic takeoff and activate hover mode as long as its pressed down. Read the Flow deck tutorial for more information. Dont worry if you don't get through all of these maneouvers, these take practice to learn and master! The goal here is for you to have some hands on experience on what a flying vehicle is like and have some experience with the physical system before we start playing with autonomy. If you want a challenge, remove the optical flow board / loco positioning board and try flying in manual mode WARNING you will have no automatic positioning or hovering - you will have to manually control this yourself. Autonomous Flight \u00b6 Having hopefully flown the drone manually, you should now be beginning to form some intuitions as to how a drone flies, its features, things to watch out for and so on. Now we move onto starting to consider a key part of this course - which is autonomy. Autonomy is a bit different for drones over other robots you may have used in the past. Unlike ground vehicles, we have to consider the effects of a 3rd dimension, and need some form of cascaded control to stay in the air. Also whilst the inverse kinematics calculations for arms are not necessary for drones - features such as smooth trajectory generation and following, and mission planning are neccesary. Thankfully, crazyflie offers a simple starting point with a python api for autonomous flight. This will get you back up to speed with programming and testing robots before we delve into more complex autonomous systems which you would see flavours of in the real world. Remember at the end of the day, all of these different frameworks are just tools - we hope that through learning to use these tools, you also absorb and learn more generalisable features of drone autonomy which you could apply to the many other open source and proprietary systems which exist out there!

It provides a complete, research-grade framework for developing, simulating, and deploying aerial robotic systems using ROS2. At this stage of the course, the goal is early exposure and installation. You are not expected to: Understand every component of Aerostack2 Modify low-level controllers or behaviours Debug complex multi-node launch issues Instead, the objectives of this session are to: Understand why a framework like Aerostack2 is needed See how a full aerial robotics stack is structured Successfully run an existing Aerostack2 project Gain confidence interacting with the platform at a high level Aerostack2 will be revisited later in the module, where you will progressively take more responsibility for mission design, autonomy, and system configuration. Please note we will be installing Aerostack2 via source . See these instructions Aerostack2 Practical Basics \u00b6 Aerostack2 should be understood as a layered system , built on top of ROS2, rather than as a monolithic or \u201cblack-magic\u201d framework. The key layers are: 1. Hardware / Simulation Layer \u00b6 This is the physical or simulated platform: Real drones (e.g. Crazyflie, PX4-based platforms) Gazebo for simulation This layer is responsible for: Physics Sensors Actuators 2. ROS2 Middleware Layer \u00b6 ROS2 provides the communication backbone: Nodes Topics Services Actions All Aerostack2 components are ultimately ROS2 nodes communicating through standard ROS2 interfaces. 3. Aerostack2 Core Libraries \u00b6 This layer provides reusable aerial robotics functionality: State estimation Motion control Behaviours (e.g. takeoff, land, go-to) Safety and emergency handling These are generic , reusable components that are independent of any specific application. 4. Aerostack2 Project Repository (Application Layer) \u00b6 This is where a specific application is defined. A project repository: Selects which Aerostack2 components are used Configures how they are launched Defines missions using Python scripts Examples include: Gazebo simulation projects Indoor flight projects Outdoor autonomous missions 5. User Mission Logic \u00b6 At the top level are: Python mission scripts High-level commands (takeoff, move, land) Mission sequencing In this practical, you will only interact with this top layer. Understanding this separation is critical: you can design and test aerial missions without modifying the underlying flight stack . Tasks: Running Aerostack2 in Black-Box Mode \u00b6 In this practical, you will treat Aerostack2 as a black-box system : you will run it, observe it, and interact with it \u2014 but not modify its internals. Task 1 \u2013 Clone the Aerostack2 Source Repository \u00b6 Goal: Ensure you have the Aerostack2 source code locally.

Choose one of the following challenges: Option A \u2013 Mission Execution Run an existing example mission script Observe the sequence of actions (e.g. takeoff \u2192 move \u2192 land) Identify where in the code the mission logic lives Option B \u2013 Mission Modification Duplicate an existing mission script Change one simple parameter (e.g. altitude, duration, waypoint) Rerun the mission and observe the difference Do not modify configuration files or launch scripts. Background to Robotic Frameworks For Aerial Control \u00b6 As robotic and autonomous systems proliferate into the wider world, there is a need to address the difficulties of system development and deployment at scale. There is evidence that industry is directly facing these challenges through the use of cloud computing, continuous integration and similar systems inspired from very successful and agile software development processes. This is made clear through offerings such as Amazon's AWS Robomaker , Google's cloud robotics and so on. However, there is a great lack of such systems in most academic settings. The result's oriented attitude of many labs often leads to each researcher building a bespoke solution in order to evaluate, validate or prove their goals. These bespoke solutions are often inflexible, not extensible, difficult to understand and, importantly, reuse, with any level of confidence. This becomes especially difficult when coupled with hardware, such as UAVs, where many operational details have been implicitly assumed or ignored for favour of getting the experiment running as quick as possible. In addition these solutions are often poorly structured and maintained with little to no documentation meaning that it is difficult for researchers to build upon these systems. This is an exceptionally large hurdle to researchers who do not have strong software backgrounds, but wish to perform real world experiments which could improve the quality of research outputs. This is not to say that it is impossible for a research system to be developed into a reusable platform. There are many examples of research systems being ubiquitous within a group or being released outside the lab. For instance, the Robotarium at Georgia Tech , the Multi-Robot Systems Group at the Czech Technical University with their experimental system , and the PX4 autopilot which began its life as a collaboration between a number of labs at ETH Zurich. But what we see is that it takes a concerted effort and many years of coincidental work which provide incremental improvements to the system each time. Previously I had attempted to develop a system which solved this problem called starling which had a number of flaws. Therefore as an example system for you to learn, we have chosen the aerostack2 as our aerial robotic systems development platform. This will enable the following: Supports single or multiple drones with low (control) or high level (path planning) experimentation. Supports the transition between simulation to indoor flight to outdoor flight. Provides a simple and easy to use interface for researchers to implement experimentation without knowledge of hardware specifics. We hope that through using aerostack2, you develop an overview of the components required in an aerial system, and gain experiences which can then be applied to whatever systems you work with in the future. Aerostack2 \u00b6 Link To Documentation Link To Github UCL fork of aerostack2: Github Overview \u00b6 Aerostack2 (AS2) is an open source software framework that helps developers design and build the control architecture of aerial robotic systems, integrating multiple heterogeneous computational solutions (e.g., computer vision algorithms, motion controllers, self-localization and mapping methods, motion planning algorithms, etc.), built for ROS2 Humble. Aerostack2 is useful for building autonomous aerial systems in complex and dynamic environments and it is also a useful research tool for aerial robotics to test new algorithms and architectures. It was created to be available for communities of researchers and developers and it is currently an active open-source project with periodic software releases. Aerostack2 is versatile for building different system configurations with various degrees of autonomy. It\u2019s most important features are: From teleoperation to autonomous flight. Aerostack2 can be used for teleoperation flights (with manual control) but it can also be used for building autonomous robot systems to perform aerial missions without operator assistance. Single robots or multi-robot systems. Aerostack2 can be used to fly a swarm of heterogeneous drones to perform multi-aerial-robot missions. It has been validated to operate with several drones simultaneously, both in indoor and outdoor environments. Flexible for different applications. Aerostack2 can be used by system designers to develop their own systems in a wide range of applications. Aerostack2 provides languages and graphical tools to configure specific aerial missions. Hardware independent. Aerostack2 runs on conventional laptops and it has also run on onboard computers like Nvidia Jetson NX. Aerostack2 has been used in different aerial platforms, including, but not limited to: DJI platforms (Matrice 210RTKv2, Matrice 300, Ryze Tello), Pixhawk autopilots and Crazyflie drones. The framework can operate in simulation and in a real environment in a similar way, what simplifies the Sim2Real development. Complete modularity, allowing elements to be changed or interchanged without affecting the rest of the system. Plugin-based architecture allows to use different implementations for every tasks. Project-oriented, allowing to install and use only the necessary packages and configurations for the application to be developed Using Aerostack2 \u00b6 In practice, a Aerostack ROS2 working project comprises of two parts: The Core Aerostack Libraries This provides the core ROS2 nodes, functionalities and interfaces and will be described in more detail below. It is simply another ROS2 library like any other. An Aerostack2 Project Repository (Application) This is a project folder which interacts and manages a specific application you want to develop with aerostack2. This contains a number of scripts, as well as the python api interface scripts for easy implementation of applications. Core Aerostack Libraries \u00b6 Aerostack2 provides existing implementations of, and methods of extending key parts of a flight control stack. This includes: Support of different vehicle platforms - both real drone platforms such as a crazyflie or PX4 and also gazebo for simulation Robotic Functions - essential software components and algorithms essential for aerial robotics functionality such as State Estimation (External Source, Ground Truth, Motion Capture) Motion Control (PID, Differential Flatness) Emergency Handling Behaviours - Individual built-in components that implement specific high level robotic functionalities such as the following. This allows a mission plan to be expressed as a sequence of activated behaviours in series or in parallel. A key aspect of behaviours is that each individually has state defining whether a behaviour can be activated, if it is still performing that behaviour, deactivating the behaviour and so on. Motion Control (e.g. Taking Off, Landing, Go_to ) Perception (e.g. Detect Marker, Record Video, Control Gimbal) Planning (e.g. Trajectory Generation) Mission Control - Highest level user facing components for designing and implementing missions of behaviours. Behaviour Trees Python API Mission Monitoring (Rviz) See this page for more details The core libraries can be installed for apt-get if no changes are necessary. However in this course, we will be building from scratch as it allows us to make quick fixes versions within our repository ( UCL AS2 REPO ). To install aerostack, you create a new ROS2 workspace and clone our aerostack into the src folder, download dependencies, and build as usual See these instructions We will be diving further into a specific example in the next article. Project Repository \u00b6 The mission control elements of aerostack2 combined with ROS2 allow a high degree of separation between the core libraries and any application specific code. This is great because it means that the core of aerostack is application agnostic, allowing it to be applied to various different specific applications. The specific application then comes in the form of its own repository which is in charge of specifying which nodes are to be run, and in what configuration for a particular use case. A python script can then be used to run the core mission logic, invoking behaviours and telling the drone what to do and when. AS2 developers have built up a recommended pattern of usage for invoking and using aerostack2 functionality. This primarily revolves around the use of the linux command line, bash scripts and a tool called tmux . Tmux is a 'terminal multiplexer' which allows the operation of multiple terminals simultaneously from within the same window. Combined with the tmuxinator tool which can define configurations of tmux windows, tmux serves to run all of the many ROS2 nodes. This makes things easier as we would ordinarly need to manual start, or replaces a standard ROS2 launch file whilst making monitoring easier in these larger complex systems. A launch bash script, often called launch_as2.bash is then used to spin up all of the ROS2 nodes representing a single drone by managing the various environment variables and runtime options, and then invoking tmux. A second bash script is used to represent the ground station launch_ground_station.bash which launches central processes such as visualisation, motion capture, rosbag recording or other external data sources. Finally a mission can be defined in python using AS2's python API and the ROS2 API. Then either from within the drone or ground station tmux, this mission can be started. Lets take a look at the project gazebo example project for working with gazebo - all of the simulation based projects are based on this repository. Project Gazebo All projects in aerostack2 are structured in the same way. The project is divided into the following directories: tmuxinator : Contains the tmuxinator launch file, which is used to launch all aerostack2 nodes. aerostack2.yaml : Tmuxinator launch file for each drone. The list of nodes to be launched is defined here. ground_station.yaml : Tmuxinator launch file for the ground station. The list of nodes to be launched is defined here. config : Contains the configuration files for the launchers of the nodes in the drones. config_ground_station : Contains the configuration files for the launchers of the nodes in the ground station. launch_as2.bash : Script to launch nodes defined in tmuxinator/aerostack2.yaml . launch_ground_station.bash : Script to launch nodes defined in tmuxinator/ground_station.yaml . mission_*.py : Different python mission files that can be executed. stop.bash : Script to stop all nodes launched by launch_as2.bash and launch_ground_station.bash . rosbag/record_rosbag.bash : Script to record a rosbag. Can be modified to record only the topics that are needed. trees* : Contains the behavior trees that can be executed. They can be selected in the aerostack2.yaml file. utils : Contains utils scripts for launchers. Both python and bash scripts have a help message that can be displayed by running the script with the -h option. For example, ./launch_as2.bash -h will display the help message for the launch_as2.bash script. Note: Whilst this is the main template, the different projects will have variants depending on their needs and therefore might look and contain slightly different things.

There is evidence that industry is directly facing these challenges through the use of cloud computing, continuous integration and similar systems inspired from very successful and agile software development processes. This is made clear through offerings such as Amazon's AWS Robomaker , Google's cloud robotics and so on. However, there is a great lack of such systems in most academic settings. The result's oriented attitude of many labs often leads to each researcher building a bespoke solution in order to evaluate, validate or prove their goals. These bespoke solutions are often inflexible, not extensible, difficult to understand and, importantly, reuse, with any level of confidence. This becomes especially difficult when coupled with hardware, such as UAVs, where many operational details have been implicitly assumed or ignored for favour of getting the experiment running as quick as possible. In addition these solutions are often poorly structured and maintained with little to no documentation meaning that it is difficult for researchers to build upon these systems. This is an exceptionally large hurdle to researchers who do not have strong software backgrounds, but wish to perform real world experiments which could improve the quality of research outputs. This is not to say that it is impossible for a research system to be developed into a reusable platform. There are many examples of research systems being ubiquitous within a group or being released outside the lab. For instance, the Robotarium at Georgia Tech , the Multi-Robot Systems Group at the Czech Technical University with their experimental system , and the PX4 autopilot which began its life as a collaboration between a number of labs at ETH Zurich. But what we see is that it takes a concerted effort and many years of coincidental work which provide incremental improvements to the system each time. Previously I had attempted to develop a system which solved this problem called starling which had a number of flaws. Therefore as an example system for you to learn, we have chosen the aerostack2 as our aerial robotic systems development platform. This will enable the following: Supports single or multiple drones with low (control) or high level (path planning) experimentation. Supports the transition between simulation to indoor flight to outdoor flight. Provides a simple and easy to use interface for researchers to implement experimentation without knowledge of hardware specifics. We hope that through using aerostack2, you develop an overview of the components required in an aerial system, and gain experiences which can then be applied to whatever systems you work with in the future.","title":"Background to Robotic Frameworks For Aerial Control"},{"location":"1d_aerostack2/#aerostack2","text":"Link To Documentation Link To Github UCL fork of aerostack2: Github","title":"Aerostack2"},{"location":"1d_aerostack2/#overview","text":"Aerostack2 (AS2) is an open source software framework that helps developers design and build the control architecture of aerial robotic systems, integrating multiple heterogeneous computational solutions (e.g., computer vision algorithms, motion controllers, self-localization and mapping methods, motion planning algorithms, etc.), built for ROS2 Humble. Aerostack2 is useful for building autonomous aerial systems in complex and dynamic environments and it is also a useful research tool for aerial robotics to test new algorithms and architectures.

By this point in the course, you should already be comfortable with: - ROS2 workspaces, nodes, and topics - Building and sourcing ROS2 projects - Launching and inspecting Gazebo simulations The goal of this practical is to gain confidence using Aerostack2. You are not expected to: - Understand all Aerostack2 internals - Modify low-level controllers or behaviours - Debug complex configuration or launch issues Practical 3: Mini Challenge - ROS2 with Aerostack2 Mini-Challenge Tasks Aerostack2 Installation Local Installation Setup and build Aerostack2 (we use version 1.1.2) Setup this project Running the simulator What does the simulator run A quick aside on Tmux Controlling with teleoperation Running the example autonomous mission Stopping the simulator Dissecting the controller Modifying the controller NOTE: If you run into any issues, create an issue on the github repository: project_gazebo_aruco Mini-Challenge \u00b6 In this simulation mini-challenge, we have setup a small project in which there are a number of aruco codes in a line in front of the drone. There are only two types of aruco code arranged such that for n codes in a line, the first n-1 will be of type 1, and the nth will be type 2. Your task is to write an algorithm which can detect aruco markers from the drones camera, and fly forward until you reach the type 2 code, and land on it. In order to do this, you must be able to first have installed Aerostack2 and the project code. You will then need to have understood how the mission script works and how to subscribe and process the drone stream. Finally you will need to work out how to control the drone from the drone stream. Tasks \u00b6 Install project gazebo aruco as instructed What are the differences between this project and project gazebo? Run Project Gazebo with the teleoperation panel and rviz2 for the camera feed Where is the camera feed coming from? What is the purpose of rviz2 and what does it show you? Run Project Gazebo with the example mission camera script How does the script get the camera data? Implement and test and aruco detection method using OpenCV What version of aruco marker are we using? With the aruco detection, implement a controller which can solve the mini-challenge Further Tasks: The generated world is defined in sim_config/world.json , with models defined in the models directory. Have a play around with the world What other tasks could you do with your aruco detection module? Aerostack2 Installation \u00b6 No matter how you run the linux system, you can try each of the following two options (Local or Docker). Local Installation \u00b6 Setup and build Aerostack2 (we use version 1.1.2) \u00b6 In your home directory (could be anywhere else but all the paths below are for your home directory) mkdir -p ~/project_gazebo_ws/src cd ~/project_gazebo_ws/src git clone https://github.com/UCL-MSC-RAI-COMP0240/aerostack2.git Make sure you clone our UCL-MSC-RAI-COMP0240 fork of aerostack2 - a fork is a fancy name for a copy of the original repository but still remains connected - such that if the original developers ever update their version, we can decide to also pull in the new updates. But it remains separate such that we can also add our own updates for you. This will create a ros2 workspace and place the aerostack2 repository in it. You can see that aerostack2 itself is made up of many different ros nodes and packages. You will need to install the dependencies by running the following: sudo apt install git python3-rosdep python3-pip python3-colcon-common-extensions tmux tmuxinator -y pip3 install pysimplegui-4-foss And then going back into the root workspace to install the remaining ROS2 dependencies automatically. cd ~/project_gazebo_ws sudo rosdep init rosdep update rosdep install -y -r -q --from-paths src --ignore-src Then, enable the handy aerostack2 cli (only run this once) echo 'export AEROSTACK2_PATH=$HOME/project_gazebo_ws/src/aerostack2' >> $HOME/.bashrc echo 'source $AEROSTACK2_PATH/as2_cli/setup_env.bash' >> $HOME/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc This will enable you to build the project from any folder using It will take a couple of minutes as it builds all of aerostack2! as2 build Now as2 should be installed. Finally add the following to your bashrc echo 'source $HOME/project_gazebo_ws/install/setup.bash' >> $HOME/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc Setup this project \u00b6 Get this project locally mkdir -p ~/project_gazebo_ws/src cd ~/project_gazebo_ws/src git clone https://github.com/UCL-MSC-RAI-COMP0240/project_gazebo_aruco.git Run the example using cd ~/project_gazebo_ws/src/project_gazebo_aruco ./launch_as2.bash -s -t Running the simulator \u00b6 In your selected environment, start the aerostack2 simulation environment cd ~/project_gazebo_ws/src/project_gazebo_aruco # or docker: cd /ros2/project_gazebo_aruco ./launch_as2.bash -s -t -v The launch_as2.bash file runs a bash script which controls what elements are also started up. The -s indicates that the system should be launched in simulation mode. The -t opens up the teleoperation remote control window to control the drone. The -v opens up a visualisation software called rviz2. You can have a look at -h for all of the different options, some won't be relevant for this task. What does the simulator run \u00b6 The aerostack simulator runs a number of different modules for ensuring successful flight this includes: Platform Interface State Estimation Motion Controllers Behaviour Controllers (Takeoff, Land, Go-To) You can see the status of these other modules if you select the terminal and press Ctrl + B and then press 0 ... 5 to change windows. In a single window you can switch between panes by pressing Ctrl + B and then a direction arrow. A quick aside on Tmux \u00b6 This fancy terminal environment you find yourself in is known as tmux . Tmux is a way for to allow terminal users to run and view multiple programs at the same time - in the case for us, multiple ROS2 nodes doing different things. Here they are organised in windows and panes. I would recommend reading through a guide such as the following, and just trying it out! https://hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/ The useful feature for us is that you can define configuration files for running a bunch of different programs - especially useful for complex systems with multiple components to spin up, but also observe (observation being one of the main issues with ros launch files). Controlling with teleoperation \u00b6 Using the -t option will open up the teleoperation panel, allowing you to attempt to manually fly the robot in simulation. With the teleoperation panel clicked on and selected, you can press the T key to takeoff. The arrow keys will then control the direction of flight of the drone in position control mode (you tell the drone where specifically to go). Notice how the drone flies around in the simulation and in rviz. Also see how the image within rviz changes! The image is from a bottom mounted camera on the simulated drone, mirroring the setup you will be building with the real drone. Play around and fly the drone around! Running the example autonomous mission \u00b6 In the original terminal (Use Ctrl + B + 5 ), we can run any scripts we want. The mission_*.py scripts are some examples of these autonomous missions. To run one of these examples, in the terminal type: python3 mission_camera.py This example mission gives you a camera stream from the drone, takes off and arms the drone and flies it around using a few different methods. Key points is the use of ROS2 to subscribe to the camera topic published by the drone model. Whenever an image is received, it will run the img_callback function. Stopping the simulator \u00b6 In order to stop the simulator cleanly, in any terminal run the ./stop.bash script. ./stop.bash This will stop all containers and relevant programs to the simulator in a clean manner. Sometimes the simulated drone will go into an unrecoverable state - you may need to restart the simulator. Dissecting the controller \u00b6 Here is the example controller. It is documented! #!/bin/python3 \"\"\" CAMERA SAMPLE MISSION This file is an example mission which reads from the aerostack drone camera and prints it to screen It also flies around using position and velocity control camera topic \"\"\" # Imports import time import rclpy import argparse from as2_python_api.drone_interface import DroneInterface from rclpy.qos import qos_profile_sensor_data from sensor_msgs.msg import Image, CameraInfo from cv_bridge import CvBridge import cv2 ######## Drone Control Class ################### class DroneMotionRef(DroneInterface): \"\"\"Drone Interface This is the aerostack2 drone interface for connecting to simulated and real drones.

Finally, remind yourself of the goal of this mini-challenge, and try to implement a solution! In this simulation mini-challenge, we have setup a small project in which there are a number of aruco codes in a line in front of the drone. There are only two types of aruco code arranged such that for n codes in a line, the first n-1 will be of type 1, and the nth will be type 2. Your task is to write an algorithm which can detect aruco markers from the drone's camera, and fly forward until you reach the type 2 code, and land on it. Note: Pay attention to the grid sizes of the ArUco markers and the maximum ID number that the detection algorithm can handle. Check the ID numbers of the simulated markers (found in the model file in the src folder) and determine your ArUco dictionary setup strategy accordingly. Here is a quick tutorial on ArUco markers on OpenCV: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html. Note: you likely do not need to restart the entire simulation every time you test your script (unless you crash out or put the drone/system into an unrecoverable state). Simply make your change and re-run the script! (Although you may want a script to send the drone back to the starting pose!)","title":"5.

This mirrors real life autonomous inspection scenarios which are the majority of current day use cases with autonomous drones. Structural Inspection Path Planning \u00b6 The structural inspection path planning problem is often broken down into three different problems 3D Viewpoint generation, in which a 2.5D or CAD model of the structure is used to determine the optimal set of camera positions which need to be visited in order to generate enough data for a reconstruction. [This Challenge] Coverage Path Planning / Tour Optimisation & Trajectory Generation, then tries to find the optimal ordering of viewpoints to visit, potentially including the optimal trajectory itself. This often attempts to minimise time, travel distance, energy or other factors. Trajectory Following & Control is then the lower level controller which attempts to follow the calculated optimal coverage path as close as possible in order to capture the images in a location as close as specified. For further information on structural inspection path planning, see this article Your Challenge \u00b6 In this challenge we focus on the second step of finding the optimal route around a set of viewpoints. You will be given a scenario which specifies: The drone starting location The position and orientation (pose) of each of the viewpoints which you are being requested to visit The location of cuboid shaped obstacles to avoid A set of scenarios have been given within the scenarios folder for you to use for development and testing. Your challenge will be in implementing and comparing a set of methods for controlling a drone to fly around the viewpoints, verifying that all of the specified aruco targets have been seen and visited, whilst avoiding the obstacles. You will need to consider the following: Optimal routing and finding a solution to the path planning problem Motion planning and how to route from one viewpoint to another to avoid collisions while preserving energy Logging to ensure that your solution has collected \"data\" and visited every target to proove completion to a potential client. Calculation of relevant metrics (time, distance, speed, etc) for comparison of various methods. Interesting things to look up to get you started \u00b6 Travelling Salesman Problem Combinatorial Optimisation Complete routing graph of all the connectivity of the viewpoints Consider the value of the weight on each edge on the routing graph Dubins Paths Visualise your paths, maps and routes Python Libraries: scipy numpy python_tsp networkx matplotlib Challenge Environment \u00b6 Just as with the previous gazebo aruco mini-challenge, this will also be within aerostack2 and ros2 and will hopefully build upon the scripts and knowledge you have gained through doing that task. However, we have created a new repository specifically for this application. The repository is here: challenge_mission_planning Installation \u00b6 For this project, we assume that you are already familiar with the installation process from the gazebo aruco mini-challenge. Follow the README.md in the challenge repository for installation instructions Running the environment \u00b6 The README.md goes into full details of each command, but essentially you will need two terminals, both in the root of the repository: In terminal 1 run the following to launch the drone simulation of scenario1, and you will see gazebo popup. ./launch_as2.bash -s scenarios/scenario1.yaml In this tmux, I have enabled the mouse so you should be able to scroll and such (still havent figured out copy paste though...) And in a second terminal, you can run the ground station, which will spin up the visualisation software rviz2 as well as provide a prompt for you to run your mission (Though you can run your python mission from everywhere, provided you source /mission_planning_ws/install/setup.bash first) ./launch_ground_station.bash # or if you want to play around with teleoperating the drone ./launch_ground_station.bash -t Remember : If you want to close the simulation down, just run the stop.bash script from the repository root in any terminal or tmux window. Building your solution \u00b6 We have provided a very basic sample solution in mission_scenario.py which simply reads the scenario file, iterates through the viewpoints and visits them one by one. # From the root of this repository python3 mission_scenario.py -s scenarios/scenario1.yaml The same camera control script from the previous mini-challenge is also available at mission_camera.py Your challenge will be to build upon this script in any way you see fit to provide an efficient solution to the problem. You have free reign to build your own libraries, use existing python libraries and create solutions which can provably solve your problem. In order to validate and verify your solution, you will need to add logging and metrics to enable comparison and proof of the effiency of your proposed solution. Finally, imagine that you are selling this as a product to a customer, you will need to provide some sort of guarantee that the task - visiting and photographing all targets - has been completed. We have provided 3 sample scenarios in the scenarios directory with which you can test your proposed solutions on: scenario1.yaml: A low number mix of targets and obstacles scenario2.yaml: A large number of targets only scenario3.yaml: A small number of targets but many obstacles scenario4.yaml: A large number of targets and many obstacles! Note: The utils generate_scenario.py script can generate more scenarios for you if you wish. Recommended Tasks \u00b6 Install this repository and run the example code What is this mission file doing? Does it work for other scenarios? Write down on a piece of paper, the various parts that you might need to implement What functionalities does you system need What data structures do you need to enable those functionalities Implement some sort of internal map representation to enable planning What sort of map should this be? What functionalities does a map enable? Find or implement one simple path planning system e.g. choose either A*, Dijkstra, Dubins or RRT to implement. What will the results of the path planning be used for? Which routes do we need to apply the path planning for? You only need to implement one path planning system of your choice. Please justify the approach taken. Find a library which will help solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) Why do we need to solve the TSP? What data representation does the TSP need? What are the weights going to be for solving the TSP Using the aruco detection from the previous mini-challenge, implement a method of checking which points you have visited, and whether the task is complete? Implement timing and the calculation of metrics What metrics are best for comparing solutions to this problem? What methods could you use to improve my solution? How could you make it faster? What are the drawbacks of your solution? Are there any edge cases? Coursework Submission \u00b6 The deadline for this coursework is 16.00 on 4th March 2026. See Moodle Submission box. Submissions will uploaded into Moodle using the relevant Coursework 1 submission links.

Set Up cfclient in Your Miniforge Environment 4. Connect and Verify 5. Changing the Radio Frequency Channel [Check your Crazyflie box for your specific radio challenge. This has already been set to your specific radio] Flying Assisted manual flight Autonomous Flight PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE TUTORIAL IN DETAIL BEFORE YOU START Manual flight \u00b6 Before you fly \u00b6 If you have followed the tutorial, you should have a built crazyflie 2.1 which you can connect to your laptop via a crazyradio or your mobile phone via bluetooth! We recommend using laptop-based method to fly first, as so far the stablization of crazyflie will only rely on your operation which makes very difficult to control through unprecise mobile phone interface. You could try fly through phones later. To mannually fly crazyflies through laptops, you need a game controller. Either playstation or xBox could work. Crazyradio 2.0 Preparation and Configuration Guide \u00b6 This guide explains how to prepare and flash the Crazyradio 2.0 firmware, install the necessary USB driver using Zadig (for Windows), set up cfclient in your Miniforge environment, connect and verify your Crazyflie, and change the radio frequency channel. 1. Prepare & Flash the Crazyradio 2.0 Firmware [This is for information only. The radios have already been updated] \u00b6 Reference: Getting Started with Crazyradio 2.0 Assemble the hardware: Screw the provided antenna onto the Crazyradio 2.0 dongle. Enter bootloader mode: Press and hold the onboard button while plugging the dongle into your USB port. You should see a pulsating red LED indicating bootloader mode. Download and flash firmware: Visit the Crazyradio2 Firmware Releases (v1.1) page. Get the latest compatible firmware file (a .uf2 file, e.g. named like crazyradio2-CRPA-emulation-[version].uf2 ) from Bitcraze\u2019s release page or documentation. Open your file explorer, locate the drive (usually named \u201cCrazyradio2\u201d), and drag & drop the .uf2 file onto it. Once flashed (the drive disappears), unplug and reinsert the dongle. A brief white LED flash confirms the new firmware is running. 2. Install USB Driver Using Zadig for Windows \u00b6 Download and run Zadig: Get the Zadig tool from its official website. Open Zadig and enable List All Devices from the Options menu. Install the driver: In the device dropdown, select your Crazyradio (often shown as \u201cCrazyradio PA\u201d or similar). Choose a libusb driver (e.g. libusb-win32 or libusbK ) and click Install (or Replace Driver ). This step is essential for Windows to allow proper USB communication with the Crazyradio 2.0. The Zadig usb driver installation step is not necessary for Linux or macOS, instead follow the link below. https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/installation/usb_permissions/ These steps enable you to use the USB Radio and Crazyflie 2 over USB without requiring root access. You\u2019ll be able to work with Crazyflie 2 and Crazyradio without needing administrative privileges, eliminating the need to run commands with sudo during development and testing. 3. Set Up cfclient in Your Miniforge Environment \u00b6 Reference: cfclient Installation Instructions Install cfclient (or the full crazyflie-clients-python package): For the stable release where you plan to develop or customize, clone the repository and install in editable mode: git clone https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python cd crazyflie-clients-python pip install -e . Launch the GUI Run the following command to to open the cfclient interface. cfclient 4. Connect and Verify \u00b6 Power on your Crazyflie: Make sure your Crazyflie is switched on. Scan in cfclient: Click the Scan button in the GUI. The Crazyradio (now emulating a Crazyradio PA) should detect your Crazyflie. Troubleshoot if needed: If the Crazyradio isn\u2019t listed, recheck the Zadig driver installation and ensure the dongle is correctly flashed and reinserted. Note: Do not fly at this stage before changing the Crazyradio radio frequency channel. 5. Changing the Radio Frequency Channel [Check your Crazyflie box for your specific radio challenge. This has already been set to your specific radio] \u00b6 Reference: cfclient Userguide Prepare Your Setup: Ensure that the Crazyradio 2.0 dongle is correctly flashed and that the proper Zadig driver is installed on your Windows 11 machine (as described above). Launch cfclient from your Miniforge terminal. Initial Connection: Connect to your Crazyflie using the default connection URI. For example: radio://0/80/250k Open the Configuration Dialog: In cfclient, click on the Connect menu and select Configure 2.x (or Configure 2.0 if that\u2019s what your firmware uses). This opens the configuration dialog for radio-related parameters. Set the New Channel: Locate the Radio channel parameter in the dialog. Enter the desired channel value (the Crazyflie supports channels from 0 up to 82, where the channel number sets the frequency offset from 2400\u202fMHz; for instance, channel 15 corresponds to 2415\u202fMHz). Write and Save the Settings: Click the Write button to save the new channel value permanently to the Crazyflie\u2019s EEPROM. Restart and Reconnect: Disconnect the Crazyflie, then power-cycle it so that it boots using the new radio channel setting. Update the connection URI in cfclient to reflect the new channel. For example, if you set the channel to 50, use a URI like: radio://0/50/2M \u2013 Click Scan again and connect; the Crazyflie should now be visible on the new channel. Channel Selection Note: The Crazyflie\u2019s channel system works by adding the channel number to a base frequency of 2400\u202fMHz. For example: - Channel 20 corresponds to 2400\u202fMHz + 20\u202fMHz = 2420\u202fMHz . - Channel 70 corresponds to 2400\u202fMHz + 70\u202fMHz = 2470\u202fMHz . Important: - When operating in the UK, the 2.4\u202fGHz band is legally restricted to approximately 2400\u202fMHz\u20132483.5\u202fMHz. Therefore, channels should be chosen so that the resulting frequency does not exceed this range. - Always maintain at least 2\u202fMHz spacing between channels to minimize interference, and coordinate with your peers to ensure no two drones are set to the same channel. WARNING At this point, you must ensure that the crazyflie has external sensing otherwise the drone will be in manual flight mode and will have no ability to help you fly or stabilise it will drift . The joysticks will be mapped directly to roll/pitch/yaw and thrust. The joysticks control might be quite sensitive so use small movements until you get the hang of it You must be as smooth as you can with your joystick control - try not to twitch in the opposite direction when something happens - this results in a hard to recover drone! Familiarise yourself with the location of the emergency stop if you feel uncomfortable press it at any time (the crazyflies can handle heavy landings) To understand the coordinate system and roll pitch and yaw see the following link: - https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/system/platform/cf2-coordinate-system/ When you are ready to fly, notify an instructor and place the crazyflie in the middle of your flying space. Flying \u00b6 The instructor will first check all is good with your drone and you have a good setup before you fly. Note: A batery only has around 5 minutes of flying time - keep an eye on it and swap it out if necessary. Just like being introduced to any new drone, you will first try to get a feel for how the drone will react to your control. Here is a list of actions you can go through to check and learn how your drone flies. Arming only test - In this test you will simply arm, wait a second, and then disarm he drone - you will not move the sticks. When you arm the drone, the motors will start spinning at minimum RPM, but not takeoff or otherwise move. Disarming the drone will then stop the motors. Does the drone arm and disarm again straight after without needing a restart Arming ESTOP test - In this test you will familiarise yourself with, and ensure that the emergency stop button works. Arm the drone and then press the estop. The motors should stop and the GUI should show emergency stop has been pressed. Floor thrust test - In this test you will start to familiarise yourself with the thrust control of the controller and response from the drone. You will want to gently increase the thrust, and you should start to see the drone looking like it wants to get off the ground. Try and get a feel for its response! Also worth noting if the drone appears to pivot to one side instead of thrusting equally from all four motors - you may need to compensate a little using the yaw and pitch. Gentle Takeoff and Landing - In this test you will attempt to have the drone takeoff and gently land in a controlled fashion. Building upon the previous, you should gently increase thrust until the drone leaves the ground. When it leaves the ground, try and hold the right thrust level if you can, otherwise reduce the thrust and try and land softly on the ground. Important A lot of beginner flyers will jerk the stick when it takes off - either plunging it into the ceiling or floor. Try to avoid this by holding your nerve and staying in control. If you feel out of control hit the ESTOP Landing Tip - Thust up a little bit just before you hit the floor, this will reduce the impact on the drone. Hovering - Once you are happy and in control with takeoff and landing, you should try and hold the hover for longer, correcting for horizontal drift using the roll/pitch correction. If you feel out of control hit the ESTOP Controlled Flight (no yaw) - Hopefully at this point you should be feeling a lot more in control of the drone (but you probably need a bit of practice!). Now try and slowly fly some shapes (square, circle etc) with the drone always facing away from you (no yaw). Controlled Flight - Now try flying the same shapes, but this time using yaw instead of rolling, i.e. always facing in the direction you want to move. It is recommended you try this by first yawing on the spot then moving forward. When you get more confident, you will be able to yaw while moving - this is the closest you'll get to FPV flying in this course! If working in a pair, don't forget to swap over! Assisted manual flight \u00b6 At this point, you may have noticed that the drone doesn't have any external sensing capability. You may also have noticed in the GUI and on the control scheme, there is a button labelled Assist Mode this will perform an automatic takeoff and activate hover mode as long as its pressed down. Unlike UGV,Drones need a method of external sensing on top of internal IMU and gyroscope in order to hover in place and not drift, especially if autonomously flying. What you need to do now is to check which sensor can help you to achieve assisted mannual flight. For commercial and custom drones there are a variety of sensors available, as will be shown in lectures, and this includes sensors like: Cameras (Monocular, Stereo, Depth) LIDAR (Single Beam, Wedge and 360) Laser Rangefinders Optical Flow Cameras External Position Tracking (Motion Capture, UWB, etc) For use with the crazyflies there are several sensor add-on boards available which we may have for the tutorial. Loco Positioning System (** we are not using this today) Hopefully we will have access to the loco positioning system which uses ultra wide band signals from multiple anchors placed around the room. This enables a tagging board on the drone to work out the drones position to centimeter level accuracy You will have been given a Loco Tag add-on board, this will need to be placed on top of the GPIO stack - it replaces the battery holder! Ensure that it is facing in the correct direction! With this the drone will be able to hover and know its location in the real world Read more about how it works here: https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/system/positioning/loco-positioning-system/ About General Positioning Systems and crazyflies: https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/system/positioning/ For the anchors We will likely need to use the Time Difference of Arrival 3 (TDOA3 Mode) to enable all the drones to fly with lots more anchors - consider why this might be. Flow Deck V2 This is a sensor which can be attached to the bottom of the crazyflie and provides hardware optical flow and height information If you don't know what Optical Flow is, it is a method of estimating horizontal motion from a camera image See this opencv tutorial for more information: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html It also has a Time of Flight sensor for measuring its height above ground level Together these allow the drone to stabily hover in one location, and estimate its location relative to its take-off location! Place the sensor on the bottom of the GPIO stack on the underside of the drone Ensure that it is facing in the correct direction! Read about the usage here: https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-flow-deck/ Multi-Ranger Deck This board has 5 distance time of flight sensors on it allowing the simple perception of the area around the drone. This perception gives the drone the capability to react to its surroundings and perform simple obstacle avoidance, detection, wall following and other tasks. It also allows to start working on environment-aware problems like Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. LED Ring Deck (** we are not using these today) While not a sensor, its an attachment that can go on the bottom of the deck! These will hopefully be used for the light-show challenge Note that they go on the bottom and do not work at the same time as the flow deck. As a result, will need the loco positioning system to work properly. There are a number of other sensors and other details too Checkout this link for a full list of expansion decks See that link for tips on mounting the decks if confused Autonomous Flight \u00b6 Having hopefully flown the drone manually, you should now be beginning to form some intuitions as to how a drone flies, its features, things to watch out for and so on. Now we move onto starting to consider a key part of this course - which is autonomy. Autonomy is a bit different for drones over other robots you may have used in the past. Unlike ground vehicles, we have to consider the effects of a 3rd dimension, and need some form of cascaded control to stay in the air. Also whilst the inverse kinematics calculations for arms are not necessary for drones - features such as smooth trajectory generation and following, and mission planning are neccesary. Thankfully, crazyflie offers a simple starting point with a python api for autonomous flight. This will get you back up to speed with programming and testing robots before we delve into more complex autonomous systems which you would see flavours of in the real world. Remember at the end of the day, all of these different frameworks are just tools - we hope that through learning to use these tools, you also absorb and learn more generalisable features of drone autonomy which you could apply to the many other open source and proprietary systems which exist out there! For crazyflie autonomy, try out the following links which show a simple getting started! Flow Deck tutorial Multi-Ranger Deck tutorial Loco Deck tutorial Example Scripts Link Your goal here is to have the drone fly in some shapes autonomosly As a bonus, see if you can start to work out how to use the LED Deck! You will likely needed to look up a little of the documentation for the api but I'm sure you can mostly use the examples to work out the best way to program the drones to do what you need.

Launch cfclient from your Miniforge terminal. Initial Connection: Connect to your Crazyflie using the default connection URI. For example: radio://0/80/250k Open the Configuration Dialog: In cfclient, click on the Connect menu and select Configure 2.x (or Configure 2.0 if that\u2019s what your firmware uses). This opens the configuration dialog for radio-related parameters. Set the New Channel: Locate the Radio channel parameter in the dialog. Enter the desired channel value (the Crazyflie supports channels from 0 up to 82, where the channel number sets the frequency offset from 2400\u202fMHz; for instance, channel 15 corresponds to 2415\u202fMHz). Write and Save the Settings: Click the Write button to save the new channel value permanently to the Crazyflie\u2019s EEPROM. Restart and Reconnect: Disconnect the Crazyflie, then power-cycle it so that it boots using the new radio channel setting. Update the connection URI in cfclient to reflect the new channel. For example, if you set the channel to 50, use a URI like: radio://0/50/2M \u2013 Click Scan again and connect; the Crazyflie should now be visible on the new channel. Channel Selection Note: The Crazyflie\u2019s channel system works by adding the channel number to a base frequency of 2400\u202fMHz. For example: - Channel 20 corresponds to 2400\u202fMHz + 20\u202fMHz = 2420\u202fMHz . - Channel 70 corresponds to 2400\u202fMHz + 70\u202fMHz = 2470\u202fMHz . Important: - When operating in the UK, the 2.4\u202fGHz band is legally restricted to approximately 2400\u202fMHz\u20132483.5\u202fMHz. Therefore, channels should be chosen so that the resulting frequency does not exceed this range. - Always maintain at least 2\u202fMHz spacing between channels to minimize interference, and coordinate with your peers to ensure no two drones are set to the same channel. WARNING At this point, you must ensure that the crazyflie has external sensing otherwise the drone will be in manual flight mode and will have no ability to help you fly or stabilise it will drift . The joysticks will be mapped directly to roll/pitch/yaw and thrust. The joysticks control might be quite sensitive so use small movements until you get the hang of it You must be as smooth as you can with your joystick control - try not to twitch in the opposite direction when something happens - this results in a hard to recover drone! Familiarise yourself with the location of the emergency stop if you feel uncomfortable press it at any time (the crazyflies can handle heavy landings) To understand the coordinate system and roll pitch and yaw see the following link: - https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/system/platform/cf2-coordinate-system/ When you are ready to fly, notify an instructor and place the crazyflie in the middle of your flying space.","title":"5.

We are asking you to investigate the difference in performance and application of decentralised swarm based approaches versus centralised approaches to performing formation flight with a group of 5 drones (minimum 3 if experiencing technical issues) in 4 different scenario stages. Swarming and Formation Flight \u00b6 Swarming refers to the collective behaviour of multiple agents (drones) operating together using local rules without a centralised controller. These behaviours emerge from interactions between individual drones and their environment. Swarm robotics takes inspiration from nature\u2014such as birds, fish, and insects\u2014to design scalable, flexible, and robust robotic systems. Swarm behaviours are often decentralised and self-organised, meaning that individual drones follow simple local rules that collectively result in a global pattern of behaviour. Common decentralised swarm control strategies: Boids Model (Flocking Behaviour) \u2013 Uses three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Potential Fields \u2013 Assigns virtual attractive/repulsive forces to goals and obstacles to guide movement. Optimisation-based Swarms \u2013 Optimisation approach focusing on local decision-making given a set of constraints. Bio-Inspired Methods \u2013 Use of indirect coordination through share environmental cues such as pheromone-based navigation or genetic algorithms. Formation flight is a more structured approach to multi-agent coordination where drones maintain a specific geometric arrangement while moving. Unlike general swarming, formation flying often requires precise positioning and coordination. Common formation flight strategies: Centralised Approaches Leader-Follower \u2013 One drone acts as the leader dictating the trajectory while others maintain a relative position. This can be both centralised and de-centralised. For the latter, this introduces approaches where the swarm my automatically elect a new leader. Multi-Agent Path Planning (MAPF) \u2013 Global centralised planning approach computed for the whole route and optimising e.g. for collision-free paths. Virtual Structures \u2013 The entire formation is treated as a rigid body and controlled as one unit. Decentralised Approaches Boids with Formation Constraints \u2013 Similar to flocking but with additional formation control. Consensus-Based Control \u2013 Drones agree on formation changes based on local communication. Distributed Potential Fields \u2013 Drones use attraction/repulsion forces while maintaining formation. Swarming and formation flight have numerous real-world applications across various industries. In aerial surveillance and search-and-rescue, swarming drones can quickly cover large areas, scan for missing persons, or assess disaster zones without relying on a single point of failure. In logistics and delivery, drone swarms can efficiently transport packages in coordinated formations, optimizing airspace usage and reducing delivery times. In environmental monitoring, swarms of drones can track wildlife migrations, detect deforestation, or monitor air and water quality over vast regions. In entertainment and art, synchronized drone light shows use precise formation flight to create complex aerial displays, offering an innovative alternative to fireworks. These examples highlight the versatility of swarm robotics in enhancing efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in real-world operations. Your Challenge \u00b6 We have created a competition style course with 4 different scenario stages to complete one after another. For each of these stages 1 to 4, you need to consider the coordination of 5 drones using either a centrialised and decentrialised method of your choosing. The aim is to route 5 drones through each scenario stage. If you have technical challenges, an acceptable minimum number of drones is 3. In groups of 2, you will be investigating, developing and testing your algorithms in simulation. Stage 1: Changing Formations : Implementing the formation flight algorithms which have the ability to changing the formation periodically whilst maintaining a circular trajectory. Compare different formation shapes (Line, V-shape, Diamond, Circular Orbit, Grid, Staggered) Stage 2: Window Traversal : Using your formation flying methods attempt to maneouever your swarm of drones through two narrow windows slits. Consider how to split, rejoin, or compress the formation to pass through gaps. Stage 3: Forest Traversal : Using your formation flying methods attempt to maneouever your swarm of drones through a forest of trees. Your swarm should avoid collisions and maintain efficiency in movement. Stage 4: Dynamic Obstacles : Using your formation flying methods attempt to maneouever your swarm of drones through a set of dynamically moving obstacles. You may need adaptive formation control to respond to changes in real time. Hardware Challenge Event at HereEast 26th March \u00b6 In your groups, you will be given the opportunity to run a viable solution on real crazyflies on the 26th March and / or 2nd April at UCL HereEast - this is an optional non-assessed task. I encourage as many groups as possible to join the event. We will be maintaining a leaderboard and points will be awarded based on success rate, reconfigurablity and time taken. A sign up sheet will be provided. As an incentive to run your solution on hardware at UCL HereEast, groups have the chance to complete scenario stages 2 and or 3 depending on logistics and the number of crashes we have on the day. A small, low value prize will be provided to the winning solution. The event will be recorded. Regardless of whether you are competing or not, I encourage students to attend the sessions to support your fellow colleagues. Challenge Environment \u00b6 Just as with the previous courseworks and gazebo aruco challenges, this will also be within aerostack2 and ros2. At this point you should feel more familiar with the systems and how they all work. To enable this challenge, we have created a new repository specifically for this challenge. The repository is here: challenge_multi_drone https://github.com/UCL-MSC-RAI-COMP0240/challenge_multi_drone Installation \u00b6 As before, follow the [README.md] in the challenge repository for installation instructions. NOTE that we have made a patch for aerostack2 and the crazyflie interface and you will therefore have to pull our versions of these two libraries and build them from source yourself. Running the environment \u00b6 The README.md goes into full details of each command. Many things are the same as your previous courseworks. However a key difference is that we are now running multiple drones. As you can imagine this is much more taxing on your machines, and some approaches to running this coursework may no longer be appropriate. Like previous you will need two terminals, both in the root of the repository: In terminal 1 run the following to launch the drone simulation of scenario1, and you will see gazebo popup. ./launch_as2.bash -s scenarios/scenario1.yaml And in a second terminal, you can run the ground station, which will spin up the visualisation software rviz2 as well as provide a prompt for you to run your mission (Though you can run your python mission from everywhere, provided you source /<your workspace>/install/setup.bash first) ./launch_ground_station.bash # or if you want to play around with teleoperating the drone ./launch_ground_station.bash -t Remember : If you want to close the simulation down, just run the stop.bash script from the repository root in any terminal or tmux window. Bulding your solution \u00b6 We have released a scenario1.yaml which describes a sample environment which contains the 4 stages mentioned within this challenge. Have a read of the scenarios file to see some of the parameters you will need to manage. TODO : More scenarios will be released shortly for testing. Recommended Tasks \u00b6 Understand the Problem and Setup : Familiarise yourself with the coursework brief Carefully read the challenge description, objectives, and assessment criteria. Understand the differences between centralised formation flight and decentralised swarm control. Set up the simulation environment Clone the challenge_multi_drone repository from GitHub. Follow the README instructions to install dependencies and patches for Aerostack2 and Crazyflie interfaces. Run a basic test to ensure Gazebo and RViz2 are launching correctly. The aim is to route 5 drones through each scenario stage. If you have technical challenges, an acceptable minimum number of drones is 3. Analyse the provided scenario1.yaml file Understand the environment parameters (waypoints, obstacles, formation constraints). Identify key parameters you may need to tune for different stages. Try not to hard core your solutions, read the initial parameters from the yaml file. Implementing Baseline Formation Flight Strategies : Stage 1: Implement basic formation flight Choose and implement 1 centrailised approach e.g. leader-Follower model, global multi-agent planning or virtual structure Choose and implement 1 decentralised approach e.g. boids-based, consensus-based control, potential fields Compare different formation shapes (Line, V-shape, Diamond, Circular Orbit, Grid, Staggered). Test formation transitions Implement periodic formation shape changes while maintaining a circular trajectory. Ensure smooth transitions between formations. Developing Advanced Adaptive Formation Control Stage 2: Implement Window Traversal strategies Design methods to split, rejoin, or compress the formation to pass through narrow gaps. Compare centralised and decentralised methods for managing formation changes. Stage 3: Implement Forest Traversal strategies Introduce collision avoidance mechanisms while maintaining formation integrity. Test how different formation control methods handle navigation through obstacles. Stage 4: Implement Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Introduce adaptive reconfiguration to respond to moving obstacles in real-time. Optimise decision-making for obstacle avoidance without breaking formation integrity. Performance Evaluation and Optimisation Compare performance of centralised vs decentralised approaches for each of the stages 1-4. Evaluate formation stability, reconfigurability, and efficiency in each scenario. Measure performance metrics such as completion time, success rate, and communication overhead. Optimise computational efficiency Reduce latency and improve real-time response. Tune formation parameters and control gains for smoother transitions. Document findings for coursework submission Provide an analysis comparing both approaches, their strengths, and limitations. Include performance graphs, data plots, and insights from the simulation trials. Discuss real-world applications and trade-offs in different industry scenarios. Suggested Group Task Assignments \u00b6 To ensure a fair workload distribution, each group member should be responsible for complementary tasks while collaborating on integration, testing, and final documentation. Our suggested task division strategy is to split by the development of centralised and decentralised algorithms, allowing flexibility based on skillsets and interests. E.g.: Student 1 (Centralised Control) Implement 1 algorithm to solve the stages e.g. Leader-Follower model, Global Multi-agent Planning or Virtual Structure Test formation transitions using predefined trajectory control. Evaluate control performance for formation maintenance and obstacle avoidance. Student 2 (Decentralised Swarm Methods) Implement 1 algorithm to solve the stages e.g. Boids Model, Potential Fields, and Consensus-Based Control. Develop an adaptive swarm behaviour that responds to environmental constraints. Fine-tune local interaction rules to optimise coordination and robustness. Regardless of the distribution of tasks, groups then need to jointly come together and share their algorithms: - Compare centralised versus decentralised performance across the different scenarios - Ensure solutions work in each scenario - Prepare a report with performance metrics, trade-off analysis and conclusions.

These behaviours emerge from interactions between individual drones and their environment. Swarm robotics takes inspiration from nature\u2014such as birds, fish, and insects\u2014to design scalable, flexible, and robust robotic systems. Swarm behaviours are often decentralised and self-organised, meaning that individual drones follow simple local rules that collectively result in a global pattern of behaviour. Common decentralised swarm control strategies: Boids Model (Flocking Behaviour) \u2013 Uses three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Potential Fields \u2013 Assigns virtual attractive/repulsive forces to goals and obstacles to guide movement. Optimisation-based Swarms \u2013 Optimisation approach focusing on local decision-making given a set of constraints. Bio-Inspired Methods \u2013 Use of indirect coordination through share environmental cues such as pheromone-based navigation or genetic algorithms. Formation flight is a more structured approach to multi-agent coordination where drones maintain a specific geometric arrangement while moving. Unlike general swarming, formation flying often requires precise positioning and coordination. Common formation flight strategies: Centralised Approaches Leader-Follower \u2013 One drone acts as the leader dictating the trajectory while others maintain a relative position. This can be both centralised and de-centralised. For the latter, this introduces approaches where the swarm my automatically elect a new leader. Multi-Agent Path Planning (MAPF) \u2013 Global centralised planning approach computed for the whole route and optimising e.g. for collision-free paths. Virtual Structures \u2013 The entire formation is treated as a rigid body and controlled as one unit. Decentralised Approaches Boids with Formation Constraints \u2013 Similar to flocking but with additional formation control. Consensus-Based Control \u2013 Drones agree on formation changes based on local communication. Distributed Potential Fields \u2013 Drones use attraction/repulsion forces while maintaining formation.

In this tutorial, we will introduce: Pixhawk : The hardware autopilot platform PX4 : The open-source flight control firmware How to set up and use PX4 with Pixhawk PX4 Hardware In The Loop (HITL) Testing Creating Missions with QGC This will help you transition from Crazyflies and Aerostack2 to more advanced UAV platforms. What is Pixhawk? \u00b6 Pixhawk is a family of open-source flight controllers developed for UAVs and robotics applications. It provides: High-performance autopilot capabilities Multiple sensor support (GPS, IMUs, barometers, etc.) Compatibility with PX4 and ArduPilot firmware Connectivity options like UART, I2C, CAN, MAVLink and DDS Common Pixhawk Versions: \u00b6 Pixhawk 4 : Standard for academic and research use Pixhawk 6X : More advanced processing capabilities Pixhawk 6C : Compact version with strong processing power Pixhawk Mini : Compact version for small UAVs How to use a Pixhawk \u00b6 This is the Pixhawk 6C you will be playing around with, see all of the ports for various inputs This following wiring diagram is from an older Pixhawk model, but should show the key elements of connecting up and powering a Pixhawk Flight Control Firmware \u00b6 There is no universal controller design of converting from user inputs to motor thrust. In the same way, there are numerous other functionalities that an autopilot can cover. These can range from running control loops for gimbals, cameras and other actuation, to high level mission following and safety features. These functionalities are bundled into specific autopilot firmware which each offer a slightly different set of features, as well as differing user interfaces each with their advantages and drawbacks. The two current most common autopilot firmware's in use in research settings are Ardupilot which offers the Arducopter firmware, and PX4 which offers Multicopter firmware. Both these firmwares are very extensive and cover numerous use cases. However, for our purposes we will only cover enabling autonomous flight through observing the mode of the autopilot. Both Ardupilot and PX4 use the concept of flight modes, where each mode operates and supports different levels or types of flight stabilisation and/or autonomous functions. Traditionally this is for pilots to change between different controller layouts for different applications. It's necessary to change to the correct mode for safe and controllable flight. The following table shows the most often used flight modes within Starling. Ardupilot Mode PX4 Mode Functionality stabilized manual Full manual control with RC sticks being sent directly to control roll, pitch, yaw and height PosHold position UAV uses onboard sensing to stay in place, RC sticks used to translate position loiter auto.hold Automatic mode where UAV stays in the same location until further instructions given. land auto.land Automatic mode which attempts to land the UAV Guided offboard Navigates to setpoints sent to it by ground control or companion computer As mentioned before, the base purpose of the firmware is to provide a given cascading PID controller for converting high level commands to motor thrusts. However both firmwares provide a plethora of other functionality from trajectory following, basic mission following, telemetry and communications and many others too. As a controller developer, it is also useful to understand the differences between the Ardupilot and PX4 controllers and what real-world impacts they have. In most of drone targeted applications we only require either position or velocity control which works fairly consistently between the two firmwares. In our own work, it has generally been noted that Ardupilot seems to be more suitable for outdoor flight, and PX4 for indoor flight. For this tutorial we will be developing a controller for indoor multi-vehicle flight and so we will assume the use of PX4. The biggest difference is actually in licensing where Ardupilot's license specifies that any developments must be contributed back, however PX4 is a bit more free allowing the forking and commercialisation without needing the announce or contribute (although this is not necessarily the best for the longevity of this open source project!). PX4 Software Stack \u00b6 PX4 consists of: PX4 Firmware - The core flight control software QGroundControl (QGC) - GUI for setup and mission planning MAVSDK (or other communication method) - API for developing drone applications Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) - Using real Pixhawk hardware for simulation or Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) for using simulated drones for testing. Autopilot communication \u00b6 Once in guided or offboard mode, the autopilot by default expects communications using the MAVLINK protocol . Traditionally this would have been used for a ground control station (GCS) to send commands to a UAV over a telemetry link. However, now it has also developed into a protocol for commanding the autopilot from an onboard companion computer over a USB or serial connection too. The MAVLink protocol is a set of preset commands which compatible firmwares understand and react to. In this tutorial we will primarily be observing the MAVlink interface, but we will not get into writing your own software with MAVlink yet. With the growing prevalence of ROS2, all of the major firmwares have attempted to provide direct communication using ROS2's underlying communication/middleware protocol of DDS (Data Distribution Service). Although we will not cover this in this module, this is what we currently use to communicate between a companion computer and the Pixhawk for drone work. Note however that even if DDS is enabled, autopilots will still send Mavlink messages down a Telemetry stream - often a dedicated low bandwidth communication channel for the monitoring of the drone's health and status. Ground Stations \u00b6 A key element of any drone operation is a competent and reliable ground station setup. The purpose of the ground station is to provide a reliable communication link with the drone and receive telemetry to be able to keep an eye on, and monitor the status of the drone. Often this is done via a second telemtry radio operating on a different frequency - in our case an SIK radio on 433MHz - with one end connected to the drone, and the other connected via USB to a laptop or computer (or handheld games console like the steam deck). There are a number of choices for a piece of software which runs on the ground station. In industry, you may see Alterion or other softwares which provide an interface. In the open source world we either use mission planner with Ardupilot or QGroundControl with PX4. In this tutorial we will trying to use QGroundControl (QGC). Tools like QGC are crucial for real-time flight monitoring, control, and mission planning . It allows users to: Monitor telemetry data (battery levels, GPS status, IMU readings, etc.). Send flight commands such as takeoff, landing, and mission execution. Configure drone parameters including PID tuning, sensor calibrations, and failsafe settings. Visualize the drone's location and trajectory on a map interface. Log and analyze flight data to debug issues or optimize performance. Ground stations are useful as they enable: Safety : Enables real-time monitoring, preventing potential failures. Ease of Use : Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the drone. Flexibility : Supports different flight modes (manual, autonomous, guided, etc.). Data Logging : Essential for post-flight analysis, AI training, and debugging. Remote Control : Operate the drone without requiring direct physical interaction. Setting Up Pixhawk with PX4 and QGroundControl \u00b6 Now let's set up your Pixhawk with PX4, connect to it and do some initial calibrations with QGC. Setup Overview \u00b6 Install QGroundControl (QGC) ( Download ) Flash PX4 firmware onto Pixhawk via QGC Configure sensors and RC calibration Use QGC to set up some automated flights (Not today) Setup offboard control (for AI/robotics integration) Install QGroundControl \u00b6 Follow the following instructions for all platforms: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/quick_start.html Power up and connect the Pixhawk \u00b6 Tidily unbox the Pixhawk box in a way that you can put everything back later! For this tutorial, all you will need is: Pixhawk USB-C cable Plug the USB-C cable from the Pixhawk to a port in your laptop Now start QGroundControl In the top left it will hopefully automatically pick up the Pixhawk and you can start browsing the settings and seeing the live view. See https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/quick_start.html for how to navigate and use QGC. Flashing the Pixhawk \u00b6 The first step for us is to flash the latest PX4 version onto the pixhawk. This can be done easily from within QGC. Follow the following instruction page: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/setup_view/firmware.html Sensor Calibration \u00b6 The next step would be to perform sensor calibration in order to calibrate the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope. In the setup menu go to the sensors tab and follow the instructions. Of course in practice you would perform the calibration after having built the drone, but this will do for now! Continue Setup \u00b6 Scroll through the other setup steps, there are a number that we are skipping in this session, but in practice you would have to usually complete: Radio Setup : It's standard to have a radio connected with both a receiver connected to the pixhawk and a transmitter with the dedicated pilot. The radio is important in order to have a backup method of controlling the drone, as well enabling mode switching between various manual flight regimes and offboard mode. Important for safety too as having a emergency stop setup is highly recommended Safety Setup : All the different safety systems built in from return to home to parachutes if they're installed. Parameters : All of these setup screens essentially manipulate the value of various parameters under the hood. Have a scroll through the parameter list and you will quickly see that there are a lot of options for a variety of scenarios. Bear in mind that PX4 is highly multi-functional as it has been written to work on anything from fixed-wing aircraft to mini-submarines! You might want to try setting up the virtual joystick to enable easier testing! Joystick Next step \u00b6 So once the setup is complete, the last thing to have a look at is observing some of the MAVLink that's coming through Go have a look at the Analyse View: analyse view , and then the mavlink inspector However you will note that because we have a \"drone\" (just the Pixhawk sitting on your desk that wont fly) you wont really be able to do much with it. Traditionally we would use Software In The Loop testing to simulate a virtual Pixhawk for testing and development. However in this class we would like to try and use Hardware-In-The-Loop testing to \"fly\" your drone. Using PX4 in HITL (Hardware-In-The-Loop) Simulation \u00b6 For development and testing in industry, we often use Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) which allows us to test the functionality of one or more drones from our laptops without needing physical access to the real drones. To be specific the SITL literally runs the exact same firmware that would be running on the Pixhawk, and not some simulated version. Often a SITL is paired with a simulator of some description (by default gazebo) to provide physics input to simulate sensors and other external devices. However for the purpose of this workshop, we have decided to introduce Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) testing. This is often a later step of development testing when you have written new firmware, or simply want to make sure the physical PCBs and microcontrollers are functioning as expected. In HITL testing, a real Pixhawk is plugged into a computer, where the computer again uses a simulator to simulate physics and sensors which is passed back into the Pixhawk. Cruically this hopefully avoids computer setup issues for software while allowing real-time testing on actual hardware. To make this a bit different, and to hopefully avoid compatibility issues with other work, we have decided to recommend the use of JMavSim simulator instead of Gazebo for this session. JMavSim is another simulator specifically designed for fixed wing and multi-rotor platforms, but does not include the general physics capabilities that Gazebo includes. Because of this it is much lighter weight, and there have been works which run JMavSim onboard in the loop for model-predictive-control predictions. Read about it here (along with keyboard controls): https://github.com/PX4/jMAVSim Installing Dependencies \u00b6 Ensure you have QGC installed with joystick enabled For non-Ubuntu, please see the following instructions: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env.html Although Be Aware That It May Mess With Your Current Installation of Gazebo Options are: - Docker (and forwarding the volume representing the Pixhawk) - Following the cherry-picked Ubuntu instructions below Would not recommend a virtual machine since we are connecting real hardware up. (Unless you just want to try out the SITL) Ubuntu \u00b6 Git clone and install PX4 git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git -b v1.15.4 cd PX4-Autopilot NOTE : You will need the --recursive to ensure all the dependencies are also pulled.

Now start QGroundControl - if you are lucky after a few seconds, QGC should automatically detect your drone. If not, it could be anything from the cable you are using to your OS not assigning the serial port correctly. Configuring your Pixhawk/PX4 installation for HITL \u00b6 Within QGC we need to setup PX4 into HITL mode - this follows the above linked guide Open Setup (click the Q in the top left) -> Vehicle Setup -> Safety Enable HITL mode by selecting Enabled from the HITL Enabled List Restart the Pixhawk (Unplug and plug it back in again) Go to Vehicle Setup again and go to Airframe Click on the Simulation airframe and ensure that \"HIL Quadcopter X\" is selected Note that we do not have an external radio so we will not be able to perform these steps (instead we use the QGC joysticks). There may be an error that comes up because of this - you are mostly okay to ignore these warning/error messages. In order to use QGC Joystick, you will need to change some parameters. Go to Vehicle Setup -> Parameters. Search and change the following. COM_RC_IN_MODE to \"RC and Joystick with fallback\". This allows joystick input and disables RC input checks. NAV_RCL_ACT to \"Disarm\". This ensures that no RC failsafe actions interfere when not running HITL with a radio control. Running JMAVSim \u00b6 Ensure QGC is closed first Open a terminal and navigate to the PX4_Autopilot repo you cloned earlier # Set Lat Long of UCL East export PX4_HOME_LAT=51.537668693830824 export PX4_HOME_LON=-0.012029639288719024 export PX4_HOME_ALT=28.5 # Run JMavSim ./Tools/simulation/jmavsim/jmavsim_run.sh -q -s -d /dev/ttyACM0 -b 921600 -r 250 If you get an error make sure you have recursively git cloned INFO Replace the serial port name /dev/ttyACM0 as appropriate. On macOS this port would be /dev/tty.usbmodem1. On Windows (including Cygwin) it would be the COM1 or another port - check the connection in the Windows Device Manager. Once started, now separately (in a new terminal or otherwise) restart QGC. Tada! After waiting about a minute for the system to initialise itself (It will complain at you a bunch), QGC should show that the system is ready to fly. Tasks \u00b6 Takeoff the drone and manually fly it around the olympic park using the joysticks in the bottom of the screen See your trajectory in QGC Try some of the keyboard shortcuts of JMavSim to see your drone fly differently Note: If you crash your drone somehow, you may need to restart your flight controller and jmavsim When in midair, right click on a location and you will get some options to fly in a straight line to various locations. Land or return to the start location Have a play with the planning tools Once you have made a mission you will need to upload it (this may appear to fail) If you can't automatically start it, you may need to manually change the mode to mission . Imagine you were a drone inspection company, do you think this software is suitable for your role? What's this software good at? What's it missing?

In the same way, there are numerous other functionalities that an autopilot can cover. These can range from running control loops for gimbals, cameras and other actuation, to high level mission following and safety features. These functionalities are bundled into specific autopilot firmware which each offer a slightly different set of features, as well as differing user interfaces each with their advantages and drawbacks. The two current most common autopilot firmware's in use in research settings are Ardupilot which offers the Arducopter firmware, and PX4 which offers Multicopter firmware. Both these firmwares are very extensive and cover numerous use cases. However, for our purposes we will only cover enabling autonomous flight through observing the mode of the autopilot. Both Ardupilot and PX4 use the concept of flight modes, where each mode operates and supports different levels or types of flight stabilisation and/or autonomous functions. Traditionally this is for pilots to change between different controller layouts for different applications. It's necessary to change to the correct mode for safe and controllable flight. The following table shows the most often used flight modes within Starling. Ardupilot Mode PX4 Mode Functionality stabilized manual Full manual control with RC sticks being sent directly to control roll, pitch, yaw and height PosHold position UAV uses onboard sensing to stay in place, RC sticks used to translate position loiter auto.hold Automatic mode where UAV stays in the same location until further instructions given. land auto.land Automatic mode which attempts to land the UAV Guided offboard Navigates to setpoints sent to it by ground control or companion computer As mentioned before, the base purpose of the firmware is to provide a given cascading PID controller for converting high level commands to motor thrusts. However both firmwares provide a plethora of other functionality from trajectory following, basic mission following, telemetry and communications and many others too. As a controller developer, it is also useful to understand the differences between the Ardupilot and PX4 controllers and what real-world impacts they have. In most of drone targeted applications we only require either position or velocity control which works fairly consistently between the two firmwares. In our own work, it has generally been noted that Ardupilot seems to be more suitable for outdoor flight, and PX4 for indoor flight. For this tutorial we will be developing a controller for indoor multi-vehicle flight and so we will assume the use of PX4. The biggest difference is actually in licensing where Ardupilot's license specifies that any developments must be contributed back, however PX4 is a bit more free allowing the forking and commercialisation without needing the announce or contribute (although this is not necessarily the best for the longevity of this open source project!).","title":"Flight Control Firmware"},{"location":"8a_practical_pixhawk_PX4/#px4-software-stack","text":"PX4 consists of: PX4 Firmware - The core flight control software QGroundControl (QGC) - GUI for setup and mission planning MAVSDK (or other communication method) - API for developing drone applications Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) - Using real Pixhawk hardware for simulation or Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) for using simulated drones for testing.","title":"PX4 Software Stack"},{"location":"8a_practical_pixhawk_PX4/#autopilot-communication","text":"Once in guided or offboard mode, the autopilot by default expects communications using the MAVLINK protocol . Traditionally this would have been used for a ground control station (GCS) to send commands to a UAV over a telemetry link. However, now it has also developed into a protocol for commanding the autopilot from an onboard companion computer over a USB or serial connection too. The MAVLink protocol is a set of preset commands which compatible firmwares understand and react to. In this tutorial we will primarily be observing the MAVlink interface, but we will not get into writing your own software with MAVlink yet. With the growing prevalence of ROS2, all of the major firmwares have attempted to provide direct communication using ROS2's underlying communication/middleware protocol of DDS (Data Distribution Service). Although we will not cover this in this module, this is what we currently use to communicate between a companion computer and the Pixhawk for drone work. Note however that even if DDS is enabled, autopilots will still send Mavlink messages down a Telemetry stream - often a dedicated low bandwidth communication channel for the monitoring of the drone's health and status.","title":"Autopilot communication"},{"location":"8a_practical_pixhawk_PX4/#ground-stations","text":"A key element of any drone operation is a competent and reliable ground station setup. The purpose of the ground station is to provide a reliable communication link with the drone and receive telemetry to be able to keep an eye on, and monitor the status of the drone. Often this is done via a second telemtry radio operating on a different frequency - in our case an SIK radio on 433MHz - with one end connected to the drone, and the other connected via USB to a laptop or computer (or handheld games console like the steam deck). There are a number of choices for a piece of software which runs on the ground station. In industry, you may see Alterion or other softwares which provide an interface. In the open source world we either use mission planner with Ardupilot or QGroundControl with PX4. In this tutorial we will trying to use QGroundControl (QGC). Tools like QGC are crucial for real-time flight monitoring, control, and mission planning . It allows users to: Monitor telemetry data (battery levels, GPS status, IMU readings, etc.). Send flight commands such as takeoff, landing, and mission execution. Configure drone parameters including PID tuning, sensor calibrations, and failsafe settings. Visualize the drone's location and trajectory on a map interface. Log and analyze flight data to debug issues or optimize performance. Ground stations are useful as they enable: Safety : Enables real-time monitoring, preventing potential failures. Ease of Use : Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the drone.

Common Pixhawk Versions: How to use a Pixhawk Flight Control Firmware PX4 Software Stack Autopilot communication Ground Stations Setting Up PX4 and QGroundControl Setup Overview Install PX4 Ubuntu Install QGroundControl Run PX4 STIL Tasks Overview \u00b6 Pixhawk and PX4 are widely used in autonomous drone development, providing an open-source hardware and software ecosystem for UAV control. In this tutorial, we will introduce: Pixhawk : The hardware autopilot platform PX4 : The open-source flight control firmware PX4 Software In The Loop (SITL) Testing Creating Missions with QGC This will help you transition from Crazyflies and Aerostack2 to more advanced UAV platforms. What is Pixhawk? \u00b6 Pixhawk is a family of open-source flight controllers developed for UAVs and robotics applications. It provides: High-performance autopilot capabilities Multiple sensor support (GPS, IMUs, barometers, etc.) Compatibility with PX4 and ArduPilot firmware Connectivity options like UART, I2C, CAN, MAVLink and DDS Common Pixhawk Versions: \u00b6 Pixhawk 4 : Standard for academic and research use Pixhawk 6X : More advanced processing capabilities Pixhawk 6C : Compact version with strong processing power Pixhawk Mini : Compact version for small UAVs How to use a Pixhawk \u00b6 This is the Pixhawk 6C you will be playing around with, see all of the ports for various inputs This following wiring diagram is from an older Pixhawk model, but should show the key elements of connecting up and powering a Pixhawk Flight Control Firmware \u00b6 There is no universal controller design of converting from user inputs to motor thrust. In the same way, there are numerous other functionalities that an autopilot can cover. These can range from running control loops for gimbals, cameras and other actuation, to high level mission following and safety features. These functionalities are bundled into specific autopilot firmware which each offer a slightly different set of features, as well as differing user interfaces each with their advantages and drawbacks. The two current most common autopilot firmware's in use in research settings are Ardupilot which offers the Arducopter firmware, and PX4 which offers Multicopter firmware. Both these firmwares are very extensive and cover numerous use cases. However, for our purposes we will only cover enabling autonomous flight through observing the mode of the autopilot. Both Ardupilot and PX4 use the concept of flight modes, where each mode operates and supports different levels or types of flight stabilisation and/or autonomous functions. Traditionally this is for pilots to change between different controller layouts for different applications. It's necessary to change to the correct mode for safe and controllable flight. The following table shows the most often used flight modes within Starling. Ardupilot Mode PX4 Mode Functionality stabilized manual Full manual control with RC sticks being sent directly to control roll, pitch, yaw and height PosHold position UAV uses onboard sensing to stay in place, RC sticks used to translate position loiter auto.hold Automatic mode where UAV stays in the same location until further instructions given. land auto.land Automatic mode which attempts to land the UAV Guided offboard Navigates to setpoints sent to it by ground control or companion computer As mentioned before, the base purpose of the firmware is to provide a given cascading PID controller for converting high level commands to motor thrusts. However both firmwares provide a plethora of other functionality from trajectory following, basic mission following, telemetry and communications and many others too. As a controller developer, it is also useful to understand the differences between the Ardupilot and PX4 controllers and what real-world impacts they have. In most of drone targeted applications we only require either position or velocity control which works fairly consistently between the two firmwares. In our own work, it has generally been noted that Ardupilot seems to be more suitable for outdoor flight, and PX4 for indoor flight. For this tutorial we will be developing a controller for indoor multi-vehicle flight and so we will assume the use of PX4. The biggest difference is actually in licensing where Ardupilot's license specifies that any developments must be contributed back, however PX4 is a bit more free allowing the forking and commercialisation without needing the announce or contribute (although this is not necessarily the best for the longevity of this open source project!). PX4 Software Stack \u00b6 PX4 consists of: PX4 Firmware - The core flight control software QGroundControl (QGC) - GUI for setup and mission planning MAVSDK (or other communication method) - API for developing drone applications Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) - The flight stack runs on computer. Autopilot communication \u00b6 Once in guided or offboard mode, the autopilot by default expects communications using the MAVLINK protocol . Traditionally this would have been used for a ground control station (GCS) to send commands to a UAV over a telemetry link. However, now it has also developed into a protocol for commanding the autopilot from an onboard companion computer over a USB or serial connection too. The MAVLink protocol is a set of preset commands which compatible firmwares understand and react to. In this tutorial we will primarily be observing the MAVlink interface, but we will not get into writing your own software with MAVlink yet. With the growing prevalence of ROS2, all of the major firmwares have attempted to provide direct communication using ROS2's underlying communication/middleware protocol of DDS (Data Distribution Service). Although we will not cover this in this module, this is what we currently use to communicate between a companion computer and the Pixhawk for drone work. Note however that even if DDS is enabled, autopilots will still send Mavlink messages down a Telemetry stream - often a dedicated low bandwidth communication channel for the monitoring of the drone's health and status. Ground Stations \u00b6 A key element of any drone operation is a competent and reliable ground station setup. The purpose of the ground station is to provide a reliable communication link with the drone and receive telemetry to be able to keep an eye on, and monitor the status of the drone. Often this is done via a second telemtry radio operating on a different frequency - in our case an SIK radio on 433MHz - with one end connected to the drone, and the other connected via USB to a laptop or computer (or handheld games console like the steam deck). There are a number of choices for a piece of software which runs on the ground station. In industry, you may see Alterion or other softwares which provide an interface. In the open source world we either use mission planner with Ardupilot or QGroundControl with PX4. In this tutorial we will trying to use QGroundControl (QGC). Tools like QGC are crucial for real-time flight monitoring, control, and mission planning . It allows users to: Monitor telemetry data (battery levels, GPS status, IMU readings, etc.). Send flight commands such as takeoff, landing, and mission execution. Configure drone parameters including PID tuning, sensor calibrations, and failsafe settings. Visualize the drone's location and trajectory on a map interface. Log and analyze flight data to debug issues or optimize performance. Ground stations are useful as they enable: Safety : Enables real-time monitoring, preventing potential failures. Ease of Use : Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the drone. Flexibility : Supports different flight modes (manual, autonomous, guided, etc.). Data Logging : Essential for post-flight analysis, AI training, and debugging. Remote Control : Operate the drone without requiring direct physical interaction. Setting Up PX4 and QGroundControl \u00b6 Now let's set up your PX4. Setup Overview \u00b6 Install PX4 Install QGroundControl (QGC) ( Download ) Run PX4 SITL with jmavsim Use QGC to set up some automated flights (Not today) Setup offboard control (for AI/robotics integration) Install PX4 \u00b6 Ubuntu \u00b6 Create a new directory to contain PX4 mkdir PX4 cd PX4 Git clone and install PX4 git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git -b v1.15.4 cd PX4-Autopilot NOTE : You will need the --recursive to ensure all the dependencies are also pulled. If you forgot to and your builds are failing, in the root of the repository run git submodule update --init --recursive . Install PX4 dependencies including a new lightweight simulator called JMavsim. cd Tools/setup/ ./ubuntu.sh cd ../../ NOTE : In default, it will automatically install another version of gazebo i.e. gazebo garden. It is an old version of gazebo fortress which you are using for our previous aerostack2 project. It has been tested that it will not affect your settings. So you could just run default ubuntu.sh file or you could also comment off codes for gazebo garden installation as we are using another simulator called JMAVSIM for this session. Install QGroundControl \u00b6 Follow the following instructions for all platforms: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/quick_start.html Now start QGroundControl See https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/quick_start.html for how to navigate and use QGC. Run PX4 STIL \u00b6 Open a terminal and navigate to the PX4_Autopilot repo you cloned earlier, see instructions here https://docs.px4.io/main/en/sim_jmavsim/ # Set Lat Long of UCL East export PX4_HOME_LAT=51.537668693830824 export PX4_HOME_LON=-0.012029639288719024 export PX4_HOME_ALT=28.5 make px4_sitl_default jmavsim If you get an error make sure you have recursively git cloned Tada! After waiting about a minute for the system to initialise itself (It will complain at you a bunch), QGC should show that the system is ready to fly. Tasks \u00b6 Takeoff the drone and manually fly it around the olympic park using the joysticks in the bottom of the screen See your trajectory in QGC Note: If you crash your drone somehow, you may need to restart your flight controller and jamvsim 2. When in midair, right click on a location and you will get some options to fly in a straight line to various locations. Land or return to the start location Have a play with the planning tools Once you have made a mission you will need to upload it (this may appear to fail) If you can't automatically start it, you may need to manually change the mode to mission . Imagine you were a drone inspection company, do you think this software is suitable for your role? What's this software good at? What's it missing?
